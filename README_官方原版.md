# VideoHighlighter

**Find and explain the moments that matter in footage you won't upload — then export a cut, on your machine.**

A local desktop app. Drop in raw video; it scores strong moments from scene,
motion, audio, objects, actions and the transcript, shows you *why* each one
scored on a signal timeline and in a report, then exports a highlight reel and
the individual clips. Nothing is uploaded for analysis, and the basic pipeline
needs no API key.

Free and open source (AGPL-3.0). Windows, macOS, Linux. Intel, AMD and NVIDIA
GPUs.

> **It's free.** To make sure you see new releases in future, please click the
> motivation button: the ⭐ at the top of the page. It's the cheapest payment we
> accept.

## What people use it for

- **A 4-hour Twitch or YouTube VOD → a few minutes of highlights.** Crowd noise,
  your own reactions and scene changes all score, so the loud parts surface
  without scrubbing.
- **A night of CCTV or trail-camera footage → the minutes something moved.**
  Object detection plus motion, on hours of nothing, locally — which matters
  when the footage is of your own property.
- **A GoPro or drone card → a finished film.** The **Auto** tab finds the card,
  copies it off, cuts the highlights, builds the reel and lays music on the
  beat, as one resumable job.
- **A match → the goals.** Write a rule for "ball inside net" and it scores that
  event by name, instead of hoping a 400-class action model has a word for it.
- **A long interview, lecture or podcast → chapters and subtitles.** Local
  Whisper transcript, chaptered video, optional local translation.
- **Dashcam or bodycam review → an account you can hand to someone.** The report
  states what was measured, what was only said, and what it could not determine.

Not sure which detector fits your footage?
[docs/DETECTION-GUIDE.md](docs/DETECTION-GUIDE.md) covers what each one is good
at and where it falls down.

## What makes it different

**[Every run explains itself.](docs/REPORTS.md)** The report is the arithmetic
behind each kept moment — the per-signal point breakdown, what fired, what
scored well and still missed the cut. It names the claims that came from the
transcript and were never measured, instead of scoring them anyway.
**[Open a real one →](https://aseiel.github.io/VideoHighlighter-site/example-report.html)**

**[Composition rules.](docs/DETECTION-GUIDE.md#4-the-composition-engine)** You
say what a *combination* of detections means for your footage — one class inside
another, counted, held over a window — and that becomes an event under a name
you choose. Because a rule re-reads detections that already exist, editing one
and re-running costs milliseconds.

## Install

Grab a build from [Releases](https://github.com/Aseiel/VideoHighlighter/releases):

- **Windows** — run
  [`00-VideoHighlighter-Windows-Setup.exe`](https://github.com/Aseiel/VideoHighlighter/releases/latest/download/00-VideoHighlighter-Windows-Setup.exe).
  Per-user, no admin. It is not code-signed yet, so click through *More info →
  Run anyway*.
- **macOS** — drag the `.dmg` into Applications, then clear the quarantine flag
  once: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/VideoHighlighter.app`
  ([why](docs/INSTALL.md#macos)).
- **Linux / from source** — `pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py`.
  FFmpeg comes with it.

Portable builds, GPU setup, where it writes, and fixing an oversized UI:
**[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

## Pro edition

**VideoHighlighter — this repository — is free software under AGPL-3.0, and
stays that way.** It includes offline analysis, live face detection, VR
side-by-side playback, CLIP search, the composition engine, model training —
including teaching a model from one box drawn in the player, which then keeps
improving while the app is idle — and the model hub.

**[VideoHighlighter Pro](https://aseiel.github.io/VideoHighlighter-site/)** is a
separate paid edition that adds real-time work on top: live object and action
overlays during playback, teaching a live category mid-playback,
find-more-like-this search, open-vocabulary detection and counter/scoreboard
detection.

Explanation is not among them. The report, the findings and the advisor are
identical in both editions — a cloud tool gives you a button and a result you
cannot interrogate; answering "why", locally, is what this is instead.
