"""Scoring a frame against taught categories, by regions rather than whole.

This is the scorer the live overlay arrived at, lifted out of its Qt worker so
the offline passes can use it too. Nothing here imports Qt, opens a video, or
loads a model: it takes embeddings and returns numbers, which is what makes the
calibration testable without a GPU or a display.

Why regions
-----------

Teaching embeds a *crop*. Scoring a whole frame against that crop-space
prototype is a domain mismatch, and it guts the score for anything that does
not fill the picture — a small object barely moves a whole-frame vector.
Embedding an overlapping grid of sub-regions and keeping the best one puts the
query back in the same space as the taught crop, and the winning region doubles
as a coarse "where it is" box.

Why not softmax against a background embedding
----------------------------------------------

Because it was tried, measured, and abandoned. Tiles of one frame sit at ~0.9
cosine to each other (same scene, same light) while a taught crop reaches only
~0.7 to any of them, so an image-derived background vector beats the category
on every tile and CLIP's ×100 temperature collapses the softmax to ~0%.

Comparing cosines *across tiles of the same frame* cancels that shared-scene
bias: two tiles of one frame are alike for reasons that have nothing to do with
the category, and the comparison divides those reasons out. What survives is
category affinity.

The trade-off is deliberate: this rewards a *localised* subject, which is what
taught categories are for. Something spread uniformly over the whole frame does
not stand out from that frame's other regions and reads low.

The two gates
-------------

A region has to be **both** genuinely category-like in absolute terms **and**
stand out from a typical region of the same frame. The score is the lower of
the two, because each gate covers the other's blind spot:

* absolute alone cannot reject a diffuse category whose vector matches the
  whole scene — its best region still reads ~0.88 when the subject is absent;
* standout alone cannot reject the most-similar region of an empty frame, since
  there is always one, sitting ~0.13 above typical.

The conjunction is what lets this answer *"not here"* — the thing the
background-vector scoring in :mod:`llm.clip_categories` structurally cannot do,
and the reason a whole-file scan built on that one reports confident matches in
videos that do not contain the subject at all.

Constants are fitted to measured live data: an absent subject peaks around 0.76
absolute with a ~0.10 margin, a present one around 0.90 with ~0.16.
