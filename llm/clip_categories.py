"""Custom categories taught from example frames.

The label-based backends can only report what their vocabulary already contains
— Kinetics-400's activity list, COCO's 80 objects. Anything outside it has no
output, at any threshold. This module removes the vocabulary: the user points at
a few frames that show what they mean, and that becomes a matchable category. No
dataset, no training run, no GPU.

It works because `llm.clip_index` has already reduced each frame to a point in
CLIP space. A category is then just another point — the average of its examples
— and scoring is a dot product against frames that are already embedded. Adding
a category costs milliseconds, and re-scoring an indexed video is instant.

The mechanism is content-neutral: it matches whatever it is shown, and the
categories are the user's own data, defined at runtime and stored outside the
repo (see CLAUDE.md).

Shared by both editions and kept byte-identical: a category is what a
community model starts as, and anyone should be able to teach one.

    text negative automatically, scoring every frame ~1.0 (see
    ClipFrameIndex.query_vector).

    Count — it must be *one* vector, not a bag of sampled frames. Softmax over
    [category, *n_negatives] makes the score depend on how many negatives were
    passed, and image<->image cosines are all high and tightly packed, so a few
    near-duplicate frames in the bag drag a perfect match below 0.5. Measured on
    a 40-frame index with 38 negatives, frames that visibly *were* the target
    scored under 0.5. Averaging first collapses that to a stable two-way
    comparison: category vs typical frame.
