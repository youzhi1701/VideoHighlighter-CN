"""Which Ollama server to talk to, decided in one place.

Every Ollama call in the app used to carry its own
``base_url="http://localhost:11434"`` default — the backend, the model list, the
capability probe, the report's dialog. That is fine right up until somebody runs
the server on a different machine, at which point there is no single thing to
change: the chat panel would reach the remote box and the report would still ask
localhost, or the other way round, and the mismatch shows up as "model not
found" for a model that is plainly there.

So the default is not written at the call sites any more. They pass ``None`` and
this module answers, from — in order —

1. what the caller explicitly asked for (a test, or a call that genuinely means
   one specific server),
2. what the user set in the app (the LLM panel's host field, stored in the chat
   panel's own QSettings so there is one store rather than two that disagree),
3. ``VH_OLLAMA_HOST`` or ``OLLAMA_HOST`` in the environment — the second is the
   variable Ollama's own tooling uses, so a machine already configured for a
   remote server needs nothing said twice,
4. ``http://localhost:11434``, which is what it always was.

The environment sits *below* the stored setting on purpose. A field the user
filled in is a decision they can see; an inherited variable silently overruling
it would make that field lie about where the run went.

Nothing here imports Qt at module level — the settings store is reached lazily
inside the one function that needs it, so this module is importable in a test
process with no PySide6 and no display.

    Two rules are worth knowing because they are guesses:

    * a missing scheme becomes ``http://``, since a bare LAN address is
      overwhelmingly a plain Ollama server rather than a TLS one;
    * a missing port becomes 11434 **only under http**. Under https it is left
      alone, because a name with no port there means a reverse proxy on 443 and
      appending Ollama's port would break the one setup that took effort.
