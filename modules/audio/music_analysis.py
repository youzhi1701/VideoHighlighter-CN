"""music_analysis.py — turn a music file into a beat grid so cuts can land on it.

``modules/media/music_track.py`` can already lay a music bed under a finished reel,
but nothing about the cuts knows the music is there: clip boundaries fall
wherever the selector put them, and the result reads as a slideshow that
happens to have a soundtrack. The single thing that makes an edit feel
deliberate rather than arbitrary is the coincidence of picture change and
beat. This module produces the timing that buys it — where the beats are,
which of them start a bar, and where the music changes gear — and leaves the
choosing to the cutter.

What this is *not*: it is not a music recogniser and holds no opinion about the
material. It measures rhythm and energy, and everything it returns is a
timestamp or a level.

Two backends, one contract
==========================
The numpy path is the real implementation and the one that always exists:
ffmpeg (or the stdlib ``wave`` module) to decode, ``np.fft`` for the onset
envelope, autocorrelation for tempo, and the Ellis (2007) dynamic-programming
tracker for the beats. ``backend="librosa"`` swaps those stages for librosa's
when it is installed. Everything downstream — downbeats, sections, snapping,
serialisation — is shared, so both backends return the same shape of answer and
no caller ever has to branch on which one ran. librosa is never required; when
it is asked for and missing, the run degrades to numpy with a log line rather
than failing.

Why each stage is built the way it is
=====================================
**Decode.** A ``.wav`` that the stdlib ``wave`` module can already read is read
directly, skipping ffmpeg entirely — that is a process spawn and a full
re-encode saved on the format most music beds arrive in, and it keeps the
module usable where ffmpeg is missing.

**Onset envelope.** Spectral flux (frame-to-frame *increase* in log magnitude,
summed over bins) rather than raw loudness, because a beat is an attack, not a
level: a sustained chord is loud and is not an onset, while a snare inside a
loud mix is quiet in absolute terms and is unmistakable in flux.

**Tempo.** Autocorrelation of the onset envelope finds the lag at which the
music repeats, but that lag is genuinely ambiguous — half and double a tempo
correlate nearly as well as the tempo itself, which is the classic way a beat
grid ends up at 75 BPM on a 150 BPM track. A log-normal prior centred on
120 BPM leans the way a listener does, toward the reading closest to a
comfortable walking pace, and that is all it can do: two candidates an octave
apart are exactly equidistant from the centre when their geometric mean is
120 BPM — at 170 BPM — and above that the prior prefers the half outright.
Nor can the correlation itself overrule it there, because the margin between a
period and its double is a percent or two while a period that is not a whole
number of 23 ms frames measures several percent low. So the octave is settled
last, and by evidence rather than by preference: if the attack halfway between
two candidate beats is as strong as the beats themselves, it is a beat too and
the candidate spans two of them.

**Beats.** Peak-picking the envelope directly gives beats that wander: it takes
every loud syllable it sees and skips every beat the drummer implied but did
not play. The Ellis dynamic program instead scores a whole sequence at once —
onset strength where a beat lands, plus a penalty that grows with the log of
how far the gap between consecutive beats deviates from the estimated period —
so it rides through a fill or a soft bar and stays phase-locked.

**Sections.** Terciles of smoothed RMS, so the tiers are relative to *this*
track and mean the same thing on quiet and loud masters. Runs shorter than a
few seconds are merged away because a two-second "section" is a fill, and a
cutter that reacts to it produces exactly the twitchiness this is meant to
avoid.

    The smoothing is Ellis' and is kept for a less obvious reason than
    blurring. Its Gaussian is sub-frame at most tempi (sigma is 0.5 frames at
    160 BPM, 1.1 at 75) and on everything measured here — attacks from 1 ms to
    90 ms — removing it changed neither the beat count nor the interval
    jitter. What it does change is scale: the kernel is deliberately not
    normalised, and its gain runs from 1.3x at 160 BPM to 2.7x at 75, so the
    onset evidence carries more weight against the transition penalty on slow
    music than on fast. Deleting it as a no-op would silently retune TIGHTNESS

    Both ends are snapped independently, which can collapse a short segment
    onto a single beat; when that happens the end is pushed out to the next
    beat, and then further until the segment reaches ``min_duration``. The
    length guarantee is unconditional — if the grid runs out before the
    requirement is met, the end is placed off-grid rather than returning a clip
    too short to read. A caller asking for a minimum length means it.

    ``max_shift`` is passed to :func:`snap_to_beat`; see there for why bounding
    the move matters on a track whose beats do not span its whole length.
    Boundaries beyond the range keep their original time, so a segment that
    starts before the music does is trimmed to the beat only at the end that
    actually has one.

    Order and count are preserved and overlaps are not resolved: two segments
    that snap to the same beat stay two segments, because deciding what to drop
    belongs to whoever chose them.
