"""Find where a video's audio jumps above its own local level, and how rhythmic it is.

This measures **audience reaction**, not laughter. Telling laughter from speech
by DSP alone is genuinely hard -- both are amplitude-modulated at roughly
4-5 Hz, which is the obvious feature and also the one that fails -- so nothing
here claims to classify anything. It reports two properties of the audio and
leaves the judgement to whoever reads them:

``burst``
    Loudness above the *local* baseline, as a robust z-score. An audience
    reaction is not absolutely loud, it is loud *for this part of this video*,
    which is why ``modules/audio/audio_peaks.py``'s fixed ``-20 dBFS`` threshold
    cannot find one: that number is a property of the mastering level, not of
    the content.

    The scale matters as much as the reference. Per-second RMS on continuous
    speech swings ten decibels or more between syllables and pauses, so a fixed
    "4 dB above baseline" rule fires constantly on any dialogue-heavy video --
    measured, once, at one candidate every sixteen seconds across an hour. The
    threshold is therefore expressed in units of the video's own variability
    (median absolute deviation), so it self-calibrates instead of needing a
    per-video guess.

``modulation``
    How much of the amplitude envelope's 1-15 Hz energy falls in the 3.5-7.5 Hz
    syllabic band. Speech scores here too, so this ranks bursts against each
    other -- it is not a laughter test. Rhythmic group laughter tends to score
    higher than a shout or a door slam.

Both are medians and fractions rather than tuned magic numbers, so the output
means the same thing across videos mastered at different levels.

``analyse`` is the whole public surface. It decodes audio with ffmpeg, streams
it, and returns plain lists and dicts -- no numpy arrays escape, so the result
is JSON-serialisable and can cross a thread boundary into Qt untouched.
