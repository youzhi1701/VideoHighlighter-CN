"""Per-second vocal brightness and onset sharpness, measured against a video's own voice.

``reaction_bursts`` answers "is this loud for here, and is it rhythmic". Both
questions turn out to be the wrong ones for telling *kinds* of vocalisation
apart. Measured against hand-labelled examples on one feature-length file, with
the loudness band and the vocal gate below held fixed so the comparison was
between vocal seconds rather than between voice and a door:

===================  =====  =========================================
feature              AUC    reading
===================  =====  =========================================
brightness           0.90   spectral centre of mass
onset                0.89   how fast the level rose into this second
high-band ratio      0.71   weak
roughness            0.69   CI includes chance
fundamental (F0)     0.69   CI includes chance
loudness             0.64   CI includes chance
``mod_ratio``        0.58   the shipped rhythm feature; a coin flip
===================  =====  =========================================

The two that survived are the two here. Loudness in particular is *not* one of
them: the loudest vocal second in that file belonged to the class the labeller
was trying to exclude, which is why nothing in this module thresholds on level.

**What this does not do.** It measures two properties and holds no opinion about
what they mean. Which kinds of vocalisation a video contains, what they should
be called, and where the boundary between them sits are all the user's to supply
-- from labelled examples at runtime, never from a constant in here. On the
material it was fitted to, one pair of classes separated cleanly and a second
pair did not separate at all, the labeller themselves hedging on five of
twenty-eight clips. A score is therefore what this returns: a threshold is a
judgement, and it belongs to whoever is making it.

**Absolute values do not transfer.** Brightness in hertz is a property of a
voice and a mastering chain as much as of what the voice is doing, so a constant
cut-off fitted on one file means nothing on the next -- the same lesson
``modules/audio/loudness_bursts.py`` records about absolute dB thresholds. Both
features are therefore reported as robust z-scores *against the vocal seconds of
the same video*, so "bright for this voice" is what crosses a file boundary.

The vocal gate is worth having on its own account. Impacts, slaps and cloth are
broadband and flat, and they outrank real vocal events on every loudness-derived
measure in the app. It is a rejector rather than a selector, and deliberately
admits most of a file -- see its constants for why tightening it costs true
positives and gains nothing.

# they threw away a confirmed vocal event that scored in the top three, which is

# peak -- but it is emphatically NOT the same measurement, and an earlier version
# of this comment claimed it was.
#
# The difference is resolution and it is not small. `WaveformVisualizer` builds
# 1000 bins for a whole file, so on a 52-minute recording one bin spans three
# seconds; this peaks over a 10 Hz envelope. Measured on two files: 66 arrows
# against 790 peaks, and 61 against 338. Twelve times and five times as many.
#
# What follows from that is the thing to keep in mind when reading a density:
# with suppression at one second, a 20 s window can hold at most 20 peaks, so a
# density of 10 means *half the seconds carry a peak*. That is a measure of how
# much of the window sits above a high level -- sustained loudness -- and not of
# how spiky it is. A short burst in a quiet stretch scores low; a steady
# moderately-loud passage scores high while the display, averaging over three
# seconds, shows no arrows at all. Both have been reported as surprises, and
# both are this, working as built.
