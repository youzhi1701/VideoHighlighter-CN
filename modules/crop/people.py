"""
people.py — how many people are in this video?

Answers one question, per sampled frame and then over the whole sample: the
count that decides how many crops the video gets. Everything here is counting;
where they are and how to follow them is zones.py and track.py.

THE TWO-SIGNAL DESIGN, AND WHY IT IS CURRENTLY ONE SIGNAL
    count_people_in_video() was written to combine independent evidence — boxes
    from the detector, skeletons from pose — precisely because each fails in a way
    the other does not: boxes merge when people stand close, skeletons stay
    separate; skeletons vanish at small scale, boxes survive. The upgrade gates
    encode that (`bbox_2plus >= 0.30 AND pose_2plus >= 0.30`).

    With pose dormant (see pose.py) the second signal is flat zero, so those gates
    cannot open and the count is whatever the boxes say. Read the gates as
    "currently unreachable", not as "tuned too strictly".

THE OTHER HALF OF THAT, WHICH IS A PLAIN BUG
    The partial-person path deliberately runs at low confidence — legs-only and
    torso-only boxes are weak detections by nature, hence PERSON_DETECTION_CONF
    = 0.10 and "Lowered from 0.4 - catches partial people" in config.py. But the
    detector is constructed with score_thr=0.40 and filters inside OpenVINO,
    before any `conf=` argument is looked at, so nothing below 0.40 ever arrives
    and the whole partial path is starved. See actions.py, where the detector is
    built.
