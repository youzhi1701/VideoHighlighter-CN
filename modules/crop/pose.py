"""
pose.py — keypoint estimation and everything derived from it.

DORMANT AS OF THIS SPLIT. Every function here needs a pose model, and the app
has not had one since the AGPL YOLO package was dropped: YOLOX is a detector
with no keypoint head, and the shim in modules/vision/detection_backend.py
says so explicitly (`_PredictResult.keypoints = None`). So `pose_model` arrives
as None at every call site, `get_pose_keypoints_for_frame` returns [], and the
guards downstream (`if pose_model:`, `if not poses: return True`) turn the whole
layer into a no-op rather than an error.

Collected into one module so that is VISIBLE. Threaded through five files it
looked like working code; here the dormancy is the first thing you read.

WHAT THE APP LOSES WHILE THIS SLEEPS
    - count_people_in_video()'s second opinion. Its 1 -> 2 upgrade requires
      `bbox_2plus >= 0.30 AND pose_2plus >= 0.30`, so with pose flat the gate can
      never open: the counter can only ever agree with the boxes.
    - the same for the 3-person promotion's `both_agree` half.
    - activity scoring, which feeds crop_core.expand_box(pose_activity=...) and
      the ROI centering in track.py. Both currently see a constant 0.0.

REVIVING IT
    RTMPose (mmpose, Apache-2.0) exported to OpenVINO IR — no new runtime
    dependency, openvino is already required, and it clears the licensing gate in
    CLAUDE.md where the AGPL package did not. It is top-down: it takes person
    boxes and
    returns keypoints for each, so it does NOT restore the keypoint-cluster path
    that looked for people the detector missed. What replaces that is a generous
    detector plus confirmation — YOLOX proposing at a low score_thr and RTMPose
    deciding which proposals have a real skeleton behind them.

    The seam is get_pose_keypoints_for_frame(): keep its return shape
    ({'keypoints', 'bbox', 'num_visible'} per person) and nothing else in the
    package needs to change.

FUNCTIONS WITH NO CALLER AT ALL (dead before pose was dropped, not because of it):
    validate_detections_with_pose, analyze_action_coherence,
    calculate_pose_coherence, calculate_interaction_score,
    calculate_movement_synchrony, get_pose_center_target.
    Kept deliberately — they are the analysis the coherence knobs in config.py
    were written for, and re-wiring them is cheaper than rewriting them.

    TOP-DOWN: `person_boxes` is required, because RTMPose estimates keypoints

    they detect on the same frame — so this is a reordering, not extra work.
    Without boxes there is nothing to estimate and the answer is honestly empty.
