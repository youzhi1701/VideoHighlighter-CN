"""
gopro_ingest.py — find a GoPro card, copy its footage off, and describe what
arrived.

Why this exists
===============
The engine takes a list of video paths. Getting footage from a camera to that
list is, in practice, the step that goes wrong: cards mount on a drive letter
that changes between sessions, GoPro's filenames sort into the wrong order, a
long recording arrives as several files that are really one take, and a copy
interrupted halfway leaves a truncated file that ffmpeg will happily half-read
later. This module handles those four problems and nothing else. It does not
analyse, cut, or render.

Card detection
==============
A GoPro card is identified by structure, not by drive letter or volume label:
``DCIM/1xxGOPRO/`` must exist. ``MISC/version.txt`` is JSON the camera writes
(camera type, firmware, serial); when present it is recorded as provenance and
used to name the destination folder. The label is deliberately *not* trusted —
a reused card can still say "WININSTALL".

Filename convention
===================
GoPro names a file ``GXccnnnn.MP4``: two codec letters (``GH`` = AVC,
``GX`` = HEVC), a two-digit *chapter* number, then a four-digit *file* number.
The chapter sits before the file number, so a plain alphabetical listing
interleaves separate recordings::

    GH010527  GH010528  GH020527  GH020528     <- what sorting gives you
    GH010527  GH020527  GH010528  GH020528     <- actual recording order

Sorting therefore keys on ``(file_number, chapter)``, never on the name. Files
sharing a file number are chapters of one continuous recording and are grouped
into a single :class:`Take`; the camera splits on a size limit, so a take's
chapters are contiguous in time and belong together.

Copy safety
===========
Copies go to a ``.part`` temporary file and are renamed into place only after
the byte count matches the source, so an interrupted run can never leave a
short file that looks complete. A file already at the destination with the
right size is skipped, which makes re-running the ingest cheap and idempotent
(the card is usually still inserted after a failure). ``verify="hash"`` adds a
BLAKE2b comparison for callers who want to pay for it; the default size check
is what catches the realistic failure — a truncated transfer.

Nothing is ever deleted from the card. Freeing space is a decision this module
does not make.
