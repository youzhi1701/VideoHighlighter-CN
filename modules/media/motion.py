motion.py — make the cut itself move, rather than dissolving one shape into
another.

Why this exists
===============
:mod:`modules.media.transitions` can draw eighty different joins and they all feel
the same, which is not a failure of imagination — it is what the mechanism is.
Every one of them is a *mask*: a shape deciding which of two frozen frames each
pixel shows. An iris and a wipe and blinds are the same event wearing different
clothes, because in all three the two clips sit perfectly still while a shape
moves over them.

What makes short-form video feel cut rather than assembled is the opposite: the
picture moves. A shot punches in on the last few frames before the cut; the
next one lands already large and settles; the frame kicks sideways on a beat.
None of that is expressible as a mask, so none of it was reachable.

So this is the other half. A motion is applied to the *ends of a clip* rather
than to the join, which means it composes with everything the mask system
already does — a soft iris with a punch on either side of it is both.

What ffmpeg will and will not do
================================
Measured rather than assumed, because the obvious approach does not work:

- ``crop`` with a time-varying **size** fails outright. Its ``w`` and ``h`` are
  evaluated once when the filter is configured, so ``crop=w='iw/(1+t)'`` errors
  with "Failed to configure input pad" rather than zooming.
- ``zoompan`` does vary size over time, and its ramp is linear in ``it`` — a
  0.4 zoom over two seconds measures 1.02, 1.10, 1.20 and 1.32 at quarter
  points against the 1.02, 1.12, 1.24, 1.38 asked for, the shortfall being the
  measurement losing antialiased edges rather than the filter.
- ``crop``'s **x** and **y** *are* evaluated per frame, so a shake is an
  over-scaled picture with a wandering crop origin.
- ``rotate`` takes an expression in ``t``.
- ``rgbashift`` cannot ramp, but it takes ``enable=``, which is all a glitch
  wants — a glitch that fades in is not a glitch.

Every motion below is built from those four and nothing else.
