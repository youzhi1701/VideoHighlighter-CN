"""
overlay.py — animated graphics drawn over the reel.

Why this exists
===============
A cut list can only ever rearrange what the camera saw. Everything a viewer
knows about a route beyond the pictures — how far it ran, how much of it was
uphill, where in it this particular shot happened — is in the GPS track and
nowhere in the footage. Drawing it is the difference between a montage of nice
landscapes and a record of a specific day.

It also answers the complaint that every transition looks the same, though not
in the way that sounds. Transitions are the join between two shots and there
are only so many ways to make one; what actually makes short-form video feel
designed is what is drawn *on* it. An elevation profile that fills as the reel
plays gives the whole thing a spine, and it is the same spine for every shot,
which is what makes a sequence read as one piece.

How it draws
============
Frames are drawn with Pillow and handed to ffmpeg as raw RGBA on a pipe, which
composites them over the video with ``overlay``. Pillow is already a dependency
and permissively licensed, so this adds nothing to what a user has to install,
and every element is a plain function of time that can be tested by looking at
the pixels it produced.

Piped rather than written out as files: a 24-second vertical reel is 720 frames
of 1080x1920 RGBA, which is 6 GB on disk and about a hundred megabytes at a
time in memory.

Everything is a function of one number
======================================
Each element draws itself for a given moment, expressed as ``t`` in seconds
into the finished reel. Nothing holds state between frames. That is what makes
an animation reproducible, testable a frame at a time, and — for later — safe
to let something else author, since an element is a small declaration rather
than a program.
