transitions.py — join clips with a transition between them, not just a cut.

Why this exists
===============
:mod:`modules.media.combine_videos` normalises every clip to one format and then
joins them with the concat demuxer and ``-c copy``. That is the right design
for what it does — the stream copy is only safe *because* of the normalise
pass, and it makes a long reel cheap. But a demuxer can only butt one clip
against the next, so every join is a hard cut, and a reel of hard cuts reads
as a slideshow no matter how well the moments were chosen.

A transition needs the two clips to overlap, which means decoding both and
re-encoding the result: it cannot be a stream copy. So this is a separate
path rather than a flag on the old one, and the old one stays the fast default
for the all-cuts case (this module delegates to it, rather than doing a
pointless re-encode).

How the timing works
====================
``xfade`` places the overlap by absolute offset into the running result, so the
offsets have to be accumulated rather than taken per clip::

    acc = d0
    for each following clip i with transition t:
        offset_i = acc - t
        acc      = acc + d_i - t

The reel therefore ends up *shorter* than the sum of its clips by the total of
every transition — which is worth knowing when a script asked for 90 seconds
and got 84.

A transition also cannot be longer than either clip it sits between; ffmpeg
fails outright rather than clamping. Since clips here are often 4-6 seconds and
a user can ask for a 2 second dissolve, every duration is clamped against both
neighbours before it reaches the filtergraph. Clamping quietly is right: the
alternative is failing a twenty-minute render over a tenth of a second.

Beat timing
===========
``duration_for_bars`` turns a music analysis into a transition length, so a
crossfade can be exactly half a bar instead of an arbitrary 0.5 s. That is what
makes a transition feel placed rather than applied.

Delivery size
=============
``width``/``height`` override the canvas. The engine's clips come off the
camera at whatever it shot — 5.3K on a modern GoPro, which makes a two-minute
reel about 1.5 GB. Rendering the reel at 1080p is a delivery decision, not a
quality loss in the source, and it belongs here because this is the only stage
that re-encodes everything anyway.

Masks and softness
==================
Every transition with an edge — wipes, irises, barn doors, blinds, clock
sweeps, film grain — is one expression over a *mask*: a field giving each pixel
the moment it changes hands. That makes a new shape a one-line addition, and it
makes every shape feather-able, which is the difference between a wipe with a
hard stair-stepped edge and one that looks like it was made on purpose. See
:data:`MASKS` and :func:`mask_expression`.

# Masks
# =====
# A mask is the shape of the join, written as an *arrival time*: for every
# pixel, the fraction of the transition at which that pixel stops showing the
# outgoing clip and starts showing the incoming one. A left-to-right wipe is
# ``X/W`` — the left edge arrives at 0, the right edge at 1. A circular iris is
# the distance from the centre. Everything below is that one idea with a
# different field.
#
# Writing it this way buys two things a list of hard-coded transitions cannot.
# Any new shape is one line, and — because the field is a number rather than a
# branch — every shape can be *feathered*: instead of a pixel flipping when
# progress passes its arrival time, it ramps over a band of them, which is the
# difference between a wipe with a jagged stair-stepped edge and one with a
# soft edge. See :func:`mask_expression`.
#
# The fields are written in X, Y, W and H because that is all an xfade custom
# expression can see, and they are *inlined* rather than assigned to a slot
# with ``st()``. That is not a style choice. ffmpeg evaluates this expression
# on several slices of the frame at once and the ``st()``/``ld()`` registers
# are shared between those threads, so a field stored in slot 0 by one row is
# read back by another mid-write: measured, an st()/ld() version of the soft
# wipe below produced 0.48, 0.07, 0.11, 0.00, 0.72 … across a frame that should
# have ramped smoothly from 1 to 0. The inlined form measures 1.00, 0.73, 0.49,
# 0.24, 0.00. Sub-expressions therefore appear more than once here on purpose.
