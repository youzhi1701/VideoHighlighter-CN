"""A paragraph per chapter: what it looks like was happening, in order.

Everything else in this report is arithmetic. A chapter can say it is 90%
speech, that a class is on screen for 72% of its detected seconds, and that two
words were said here and nowhere else -- and a person reading all three still
cannot tell you what happened in it. That gap is not a missing measurement. It
is the difference between description and narration, and no threshold over a
number closes it.

So this is the one part of the report written by a model, and it is built to be
obviously that. Three things keep it honest:

**It is given evidence, not asked to imagine.** The prompt for a chapter is the
sentences :mod:`modules.report.highlight_prose` already produced for it, the speech
transcribed inside it, and -- when the model can see -- a few frames from it.
Nothing is asked for that the material does not contain.

**It cannot introduce a figure.** Every number in a chapter block was computed
before this ran and is printed beside the paragraph. A reader who doubts a
sentence has the quotes and the measurements directly underneath it, which is
the whole reason the paragraph sits inside the chapter rather than replacing it.

**It is labelled, in the record and on the page.** ``story`` is stored next to
the model that wrote it, and the section says a model wrote it. A reading that
is presented as a measurement is worse than no reading; a reading that says what
it is costs the reader nothing to discount.

The chapters are told in order, each one handed a sentence of what preceded it,
because that is the difference between a list of scene descriptions and
something that reads continuously. It is also the one place a model can go
wrong cheaply and invisibly -- a wrong guess in chapter three becomes the
premise of chapter four -- so what is passed forward is deliberately short.
