"""A paragraph per kept clip, read off the clip's own frames.

:mod:`modules.narration.chapter_story` closes this gap for a *chapter*: a stretch of
several minutes, told mostly from what was said in it. That works, and on a
video with a transcript it works well enough that the clip cards need nothing —
each one already carries the lines spoken over it, and "said here" turns out to
be most of what a reader wanted when they asked what a moment was.

On footage with no speech there is nothing in that slot at all, and the
difference between the two reports is stark. Everything under "The moments, in
order" is still true — the movement burst, the level against the video's median,
the classifier's reading — and none of it says what is on screen. A page that
can describe a moment in six measured sentences without once mentioning what is
in the picture is not a page that has explained the moment.

So this asks the model that *can* see. One call per kept clip, a few frames
spread across it, and the sentences the report already wrote about it — the same
three commitments :mod:`modules.narration.chapter_story` makes, for the same reasons:

**It is given evidence, not asked to imagine.** The frames, the measured
sentences, the detector's labels, anything said, and any notes a narration pass
already wrote over this span. Nothing is asked for that the material does not
contain.

**It cannot introduce a figure.** Every number on the card was computed before
this ran and is printed under the paragraph. The reading sits above the evidence
it was written from, inside the same card, so a reader who doubts a sentence
does not have to leave it.

**It is labelled, in the record and on the page.** ``story`` on the segment,
``clip_story`` on the report, and the words "read from this clip" on the card.

Where it differs from the chapter pass
--------------------------------------

A chapter is minutes long and is told in order, each one handed what came
before, because a run of chapters should read continuously. A clip is thirty
seconds and its neighbour is often twenty minutes away, so there is nothing to
continue *from* — the carry exists here only to stop fourteen cards opening with
the same sentence, and it is the one thing the previous clip is used for.

The other difference is what the frames are for. A chapter's frames are a
sanity check on a paragraph the transcript could mostly have written; here they
are the whole content, and the prompt says so. Frames are sampled across the
clip rather than at its peak second precisely so the answer can be about what
*changes* — which is the one thing the thumbnail already on the card cannot show,
and generally what the clip was picked for.

Cost
----

One vision call per kept clip: fourteen clips is a minute or two on a local
model, against the hours a whole-video narration costs. That ratio is the reason
this exists as its own pass rather than as a filter over
:mod:`modules.narration.moment_narration` — but when a narration *has* been run, its notes
for these seconds are handed over as material, because a note written from a
frame beats a second guess at the same frame.

    "7. Expression labels come from a five-class classifier that cannot tell a "
    "performed expression from a felt one. Do not treat them as feelings.\n"
    "8. When a previous clip is given, do not recap it and do not open the same "
    "way; say what is different here.\n"
    "9. When the run has flagged something here -- a detected label or a "
    "composition rule -- neither ignore it nor repeat it as fact. Say whether "
    "what you can see supports it, and attribute it to the run: 'the run "
    "flagged X here, and the frames show / do not show Y'. If the frames "
