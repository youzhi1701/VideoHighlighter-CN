"""What models this machine already has, so nothing has to be typed from memory.

The report's model dialog asked for an Ollama model as free text. The server it
is about to talk to holds the authoritative list, the chat panel has been
reading that list for years, and the dialog next to it made the user remember a
tag and spell it right — a model name typed with a typo is indistinguishable
from one that is not pulled yet, and the failure arrives minutes later at the
end of a generation the user waited for.

So this is the "ask the machine" half, kept out of :mod:`modules.narration.llm_models`
because that module is deliberately pure — parsing and naming what was stored,
no I/O — and out of the dialog because a widget that reaches the network in its
constructor cannot be opened in a test.

Two sources, both already existing
----------------------------------

**The Ollama server**, via :func:`llm.llm_module.get_ollama_models`. Cached for
the life of the process: the list changes when somebody pulls a model, which is
not something that happens between two openings of a dialog, and the call costs
a three-second timeout every time the server is *not* running — which is exactly
the case where a user opens the dialog repeatedly wondering what is wrong.
``refresh=True`` is the Refresh button and bypasses the cache.

**The GGUF files the chat panel has been used with.** Deliberately the same
QSettings list the panel itself writes, not a second one of the report's own. A
file browsed to in either place shows up in both, which is what somebody who
has already picked that model once expects, and two private lists of the same
thing is how they end up disagreeing about which model is "recent".

Nothing here raises. Every function answers with an empty list when the server
is down, the package is missing, or Qt is not available — the dialog stays
usable and says so, because the fallback for all of this is the typing that
already worked.
