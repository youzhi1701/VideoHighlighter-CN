"""Run the narration passes over a finished report, in one call.

The chapter walk and the clip read already know how to narrate a report on
disk. What they lacked was somewhere to be called from that is not a menu: both
were reachable only from the AI-summary button, which meant the answer to "what
is in this video" existed only if the user knew to ask for it after the run had
already finished, and then waited through a second pass with the window frozen.

So this module is the joining piece — build the model once, run whichever
passes are turned on, report progress, stop when the run stops. It carries no
Qt and no pipeline state, which is what lets the pipeline call it mid-run and
the window call it from a menu without either growing a copy of the other's
logic.

Both passes are cheap to *decide* and expensive to *run*, so the decision is
made here and stated in the log before the first call: several minutes of
apparent silence is the failure mode this pass has, and the fix is saying what
is about to happen rather than making it faster.

Why the model is built once for both: each pass loading its own would hold two
copies of a vision model in memory at the same moment on a machine that usually
cannot spare one.

# What a run does when nothing says otherwise: both, at both scales. They answer
# different questions and neither substitutes for the other — a clip paragraph
# says what is in these few seconds, a chapter paragraph says what the stretch
# they sit in was doing — so a report with one and not the other can always be
# asked something it cannot answer.
#
# The cost is the honest objection and it is real: this is a model call per
# chapter *plus* one per clip, and on a local model that is the slowest thing
# the report does by a wide margin. It is defaulted on anyway because a run the
# user has already committed minutes to is the cheapest possible moment to spend
# them, and the alternative — discovering afterwards that the question needs a
# second pass over footage now finished — costs the whole wait again. Both
# checkboxes turn it off for a run that does not want it.
