"""The advisor: findings, the pages that explain them, and an optional narrator.

The split matters more than either half. ``highlight_advice`` computes *what* is
wrong from the report, deterministically. ``docs/advisor`` says what that means
and what to do about it. This module joins them, and — only if a local model is
actually available — asks it to phrase the result for someone who did not write
the pipeline.

Everything works with no model present. ``advise()`` returns findings and their
documentation whether or not anything can generate text; the narrator is a
bonus layer, not the mechanism. That is deliberate: the app must not acquire a
hard dependency on a language model, and a user without one should still be told
why their highlight came out the way it did.

The model is given the findings and the matching pages as its material, and told
to work only from them. It cannot invent a finding, because it does not compute
them; the worst it can do is describe a real finding badly.

Standalone usage — findings need nothing installed, narration needs a model:

    python -m modules.report.advisor "D:\\clips\\a_why.json"
    python -m modules.report.advisor "D:\\clips\\a_why.json" --llm
    python -m modules.report.advisor "D:\\clips\\a_why.json" --llm --ask "why so short?"

# rather than the settings. Kept as its own prompt because the two ask for
# opposite behaviour -- the advisor above must never speculate, and this is

# loud that it is reading rather than measuring, and it cannot introduce a
# figure, so anything it suggests can be checked against the sections above it.

    Never called automatically: narration costs seconds to minutes, and paying
    that on every render — for prose that repeats findings already on the page —
    would be a poor trade.

    ``model`` is an Ollama tag or, for ``llama-cpp``, the path to a ``.gguf``.
    The two go to different constructor arguments — ``LLMModule`` takes a name
    as ``model`` and a file as ``model_path``, and passing a path as the name
    left the backend with an empty path and a "GGUF model not found:" that named
    no file. The model picker has offered a .gguf path since it was written, so
    every attempt to use one from here failed that way.

    ``mmproj`` is ignored unless ``vision`` is asked for, and that is not a
    tidiness rule. Handing llama-cpp a projector makes it build a
    ``Llava15ChatHandler``, which replaces the model's own chat template with
    LLaVA's ``USER:``/``ASSISTANT:`` format. An instruct model prompted that way
    answers in the wrong shape, trips the stop sequences on its first line, and
    returns nothing — which surfaces as "the model returned nothing" and reads
    for all the world like a refusal. The report's narration sends no images, so
    it has nothing to gain from a projector and a working answer to lose.
