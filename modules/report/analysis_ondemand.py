"""On-demand single-analysis runners for the timeline viewer.

The timeline viewer is otherwise read-only over whatever the main GUI already
computed. When a cache is missing actions, objects, or a transcript, the user
had to go back to the first GUI and re-run the whole pipeline. This module lets
the viewer run *one* analysis on the loaded video and fold the result straight
into the cache.

Design:
- Thin wrappers over the same entry points the pipeline uses
  (`get_transcript_segments`, `run_action_detection`, `run_object_detection_single`
  fed the YOLOX detector), so behaviour and model choice never drift
  from a full run.
- The *advanced* knobs stay in the first GUI. Here we read that GUI's saved
  `config.yaml` for defaults (Whisper model, object list, confidence, sample
  rate, YOLO model size), so a viewer button runs "what the main GUI is
  currently set to".
- Every heavy import (torch, whisper, openvino) lives inside the function
  that needs it, so importing this module stays cheap and the viewer never
  hard-depends on a model runtime at construction time.
- Each runner takes a uniform `progress(current, total, task, details)`
  callback — the shape all three underlying functions already emit — and an
  optional `cancel` `threading.Event`. Each returns data already in the
  on-disk cache shape (see `pipeline.collect_analysis_data`), so the caller
  only has to merge and redraw.

    The engine is pure: it reads per-frame boxes and per-second signals and
    writes event names, and never touches the video or a detector. But in
    ``pipeline.py`` it only runs *inside* a fresh object-detection pass, so
    editing one rule meant re-detecting the whole video to see the effect —
    minutes or hours for a change that takes the engine milliseconds. This runs
    it on its own.

    It also *fetches its own inputs*, because a rule set says what it needs and
    making the user work that out was the remaining reason this was not simply
    a Run button. Signals named by the enabled rules are measured from the file
    here (cached, so the second run is instant), and if those rules read
    detection classes the cache does not have, ``detect_fn(classes, ...)`` is
    called to go and get them. Passing no ``detect_fn`` keeps the older
    behaviour of failing with "run object detection first" — the caller decides
    whether starting a long pass unasked is acceptable.

    Only what the *enabled* rules mention is measured, both ways round: an
    unticked rule costs nothing.

    Returns a cache patch containing the rebuilt ``objects`` list (plus
    ``object_bboxes`` when a detection pass ran here).

    Idempotent by construction: every name the current rule set can emit is
    stripped from the cached seconds before the new results are folded in, so
    running it repeatedly converges instead of accumulating duplicates. Because
    the strip list comes from the rules file, deleting a rule also removes its
    events on the next run.

    Composed boxes are deliberately NOT written back to ``object_bboxes``. That
    list is the detector's record; keeping derived entries out of it is what
    makes re-running safe, since a composed entry is otherwise
    indistinguishable from a detection.
