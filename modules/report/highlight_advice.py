"""Work out why a highlight disappointed, from the record of how it was made.

The report already says what happened. What a dissatisfied user needs is the
next sentence — *why* it happened and which knob changes it — and that is
mostly not a reasoning problem. "Every point came from one signal because the
other six are weighted zero" is a fact about a settings table, derivable from
the record with arithmetic. Findings are therefore computed here,
deterministically, and can be shown with no model present at all.

A language model is useful one layer up: phrasing these findings for someone who
did not write the pipeline, and answering the follow-up question. It is given
the findings and the matching pages from ``docs/advisor`` as its material — the
knowledge lives in the documentation, not in the weights, so it can be corrected
by editing a file. That also bounds what the advisor can say: a model that
cannot invent a finding cannot invent a recommendation.

Each finding carries the evidence that produced it. An advisor the user cannot
check is one they stop trusting the first time it is wrong.
