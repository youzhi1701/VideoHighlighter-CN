"""Say what a moment was, in a sentence, from what was measured.

The report already knows a clip peaked at -1 dBFS in the 100th percentile with
two signals landing 0.3s apart. A person reading that has to do the translation
themselves, every row, and mostly does not — so a report full of true numbers
communicates less than one plain sentence would.

This is the translation, and it is deterministic. Every clause is produced by a
threshold over a measurement, so a sentence can be traced back to the figures
printed beside it and cannot say more than the data supports. No model is
involved: a language model asked to do this would produce better prose and
occasionally invent a reason, and the second thing costs more than the first
gains.

The hardest discipline here is refusing to flatter. Most moments in most videos
are not exceptional, and a report that calls every one of them outstanding is
worth exactly as much as one that says nothing. When the numbers are ordinary
the sentence says so — and when everything in a run scored alike, saying *that*
is the most useful sentence available, because it means the ranking had nothing
to work with.
