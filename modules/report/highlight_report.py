"""Explain why each highlight was chosen — as data, then as a page.

The pipeline already computes a full justification for every moment it keeps:
per-signal point breakdown, which objects and actions fired, the confidence
tier an action landed in, and whether the multi-signal boost applied. Until now
that went to ``print()`` and was discarded with the debug log.

This module turns the same numbers into a structured record and renders it.
``build_report`` does the attribution, and the renderers are views over its
output — so the text a developer reads in the debug log and the page a user
opens can never disagree about what happened.

Three constraints shaped it:

* **No new dependencies.** ``matplotlib`` is ``--exclude-module``'d from the
  frozen build, so score bars are CSS. ``numpy`` is already a hard dependency
  and is the only import beyond the standard library.
* **Self-contained output.** The HTML embeds its styles and its thumbnails as
  ``data:`` URIs, so the report is one file a user can email. Nothing is
  fetched when it is opened.
* **No knowledge of editions.** Signals arrive as a dict; whichever ones the
  caller ran are the ones reported. A build with extra detectors produces a
  richer report through the same code path, with nothing to gate.

Thumbnails are injected rather than extracted here (``thumbnail_fn``), which
keeps the module testable without a video file or OpenCV.

    """Attribute every kept segment to the evidence that selected it.

    ``signals`` maps the keys in :data:`SIGNAL_LABELS` to per-second arrays;
    absent keys are simply reported as zero, so a caller that never ran a
    detector does not have to fabricate one.

    ``action_percentiles`` is keyed by action name (the pipeline computes them
    per action type) and is used only to label a confidence tier.

    ``composed_event_names`` lets the report tell a composed event apart from the
    raw detections it was built out of; see :func:`split_tags`.

    ``waveform`` is the loudness envelope of the whole video — the caller's
    existing ``extract_waveform_data`` output, either ``(min, max, rms)`` triples
    or bare amplitudes. It is reported even when audio contributed no points,
    because "was anything happening acoustically here?" is context the reader
    wants whether or not the scoring used it.

    ``expressions`` is the per-second expression scan (either shape
    ``modules.vision.face_scan`` produces). Together with ``bbox_cache`` it is what
    lets each clip be compared with the rest of the video on what was *on
    screen* rather than on what it scored; see :mod:`modules.segments.highlight_compare`.

    ``loudness_levels`` is per-second loudness in dBFS from
    ``modules.audio.loudness_bursts.detect(include_levels=True)``. Supplying it adds
    two things: the loudest second of each clip with whatever was labelled
    there, and a whole-video comparison of the level measured during each class.
    The second of those is a claim rather than a description, so
    :mod:`modules.audio.level_by_class` prints the smallest difference the material
    could resolve beside it and declines to rank when the effect is below that.

    ``chapters`` is ``modules.segments.chapters.chapterize``'s partition. Supplying it
    files every clip under the stretch it came from and measures each stretch
    against the whole video; see :mod:`modules.segments.chapter_compare`. It is optional
    and costs nothing when absent — a report without it is exactly the report
    that was produced before chapters existed.

    ``transcript`` is ``modules.audio.transcript.get_transcript_segments``'s output —
    ``start``/``end``/``text``, optionally ``speaker``. It is the only input here
    that carries a *vocabulary*, and it is used for description rather than for
    scoring: each chapter gains how much of it is speech, the words it used that
    the other chapters did not, and a few timestamped lines; each clip gains what
    was said during it. See :mod:`modules.segments.chapter_speech`. Supplying it changes
    nothing that was measured — a run with and a run without produce the same
    clips — so the two reports are directly comparable.

    Near-misses are the highest-scoring seconds *not* covered by any kept
    segment. They are what a user would tune the weights to capture, so they are
    reported alongside the selections rather than hidden.
