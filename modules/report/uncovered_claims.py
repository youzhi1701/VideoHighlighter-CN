"""Lines this report already quotes that nothing in the run measured.

:mod:`modules.report.spoken_evidence` finds the sentences whose words a class name
covers, and answers them with figures. This is the other side of the same
comparison, and it exists because of what the two sides look like on a page: a
chapter block where somebody names something the detector found carries a
measurement, and the block right next to it, where somebody said something just
as substantial about something nothing was watching for, carries **the quote and
silence**. A reader cannot tell that second case from a claim that was checked
and passed. Both look like a sentence nobody argued with.

Why not :mod:`modules.report.vocabulary_gap`
-------------------------------------

That module answers a different question and answers it well: which *words* does
a stretch keep coming back to that no class covers. Its bar is frequency —
several occurrences, far above the video's own rate — and that bar is right for
what it does, because a subject a stretch is *about* is a subject it repeats.

The most informative thing anybody says in a video is often said exactly once.
Somebody states a preference, names what they were hoping for, says what they
liked most. It is one sentence, it never repeats, and it is the sentence the
whole report should be tested against — and a frequency detector cannot see it,
at any threshold, because there is nothing frequent about it. Measured on a
real transcript: the claim was one line, the words carrying it were said once,
and the eight gaps that *were* reported for the same file were filler and stray
nouns. This module is what makes that sentence visible.

The candidate set is what the report already prints
---------------------------------------------------

Not every line of dialogue — the chapter's kept quotes, from
:func:`modules.segments.chapter_speech.quotes_for`. Three reasons, and the second one is
not obvious.

**They are already the substantial lines.** A quote is picked for carrying
vocabulary unusual for this video, which is as close to "contains an assertion"
as anything measurable here gets.

**They are already de-duplicated.** Whisper loops on hard audio and emits the
same sentence eight times in a row; ranked over raw dialogue, those eight
copies take the entire list. Quotes are spaced across the chapter, so the loop
contributes one line. This was not predicted — it was what the first pass over
real footage returned.

**They are on the page.** The claim this reports is one the reader is being
shown anyway. That makes the finding honest in a way a line dug out of the
transcript would not be: the report is not raising something obscure, it is
admitting that a sentence it chose to print has nothing beside it.

The bar, and what it excludes
-----------------------------

A line qualifies when **no** token of it is a token of any class or event name —
if one is, :mod:`modules.report.spoken_evidence` has the line and has figures for it,
and reporting it here as unmeasured would contradict the block above it.

Length does the rest. "Uh huh." is a chapter's top quote on real footage and
genuinely distinctive of it, and it is not a claim about anything. Ranking by
total unusual vocabulary rather than by density — the opposite of what
:func:`quotes_for` does — is what separates the two: a claim is a sentence, and
density rewards the shortest line that contains one rare word. The same crude
proxy as the seed in ``main.py``'s rule dialog, for the same reason and with
the same honesty about what it is.

No lexicon decides any of it, here or anywhere below. Nothing in this file
knows what a claim is *about*, and the ranking would behave the same on a
transcript in any language.
