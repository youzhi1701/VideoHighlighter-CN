"""Run the composition rules over whatever detections a run ended up with.

The engine itself lives in ``video_ai_editor.composition_engine``. What lives
here is the one thing every caller of it needs and none of them should be
writing twice: applying it *idempotently* to a set of detections that may
already contain the results of a previous pass.

Why this is its own module
--------------------------

It began as a block inside the pipeline's object-detection branch, which meant
the rules only ever ran when objects were re-detected. Editing a rule and
re-running therefore changed nothing at all: the detections came from cache, the
engine never executed, and the report showed the previous rule set's events with
no indication that the file had been touched. The user's only remedy was to
delete the cache by hand and pay for a full re-detection -- minutes to hours --
to apply a change that costs milliseconds.

That is the wrong trade, because rules are cheap and detections are expensive.
Rules are a *reading* of boxes that already exist; nothing about changing one
requires looking at the video again. So the engine now runs on every pass, over
whatever boxes are to hand, and the cache keeps its job of storing the
expensive half.

Doing that safely is the whole content of this file. A cached detection set
already has the previous pass's event names merged into it and the previous
pass's event boxes appended to it, so running the engine again without removing
them first would double-count every event, leave events from deleted rules in
place for ever, and -- worst -- feed the previous pass's event boxes back in as
though they were detections, letting a rule match against its own output.

Stripping is by name, and by the full name list rather than by what fired.
A rule that matched nothing this time still has to have last time's matches
removed, or a deleted rule outlives the file it was deleted from.

The pipeline's side of this is an import and one call, deliberately: that file
diverges between the two editions and every line added to it is a line to be
ported by hand and a line that can drift.

    A rule made only of signal conditions needs no boxes at all, which is why
    the early return below tests for signals as well: a video that was never
    object-detected can still carry signal-only events, and returning early on
    an empty box list would silently drop every one of them.
