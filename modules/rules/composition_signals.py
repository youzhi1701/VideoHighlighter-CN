"""Gather the per-second signals a composition rule can test.

``CompositionEngine`` takes a mapping of signal name to per-second values and
knows nothing about where any of them came from — which is the point, but it
leaves somebody having to find them. This is that somebody, kept out of
``pipeline.py`` because that file diverges between the two editions and every
line added to it is a line to be ported by hand.

What a rule can refer to
------------------------

``audio_level``
    dBFS per second. Absolute, so a threshold on it is a threshold on the
    mastering as much as on the content; ``vocal_effort`` is almost always the
    one wanted instead.

``vocal_brightness``, ``vocal_onset``, ``vocal_effort``
    From ``modules/audio/vocal_signals.py``, as z-scores against the video's own
    vocal seconds. Zero outside that module's vocal gate — a value describing
    something that is not a voice is not reported as one.

``vocal_density``, ``vocal_density_pct``
    How concentrated the loud seconds are around this one — the measurement
    that actually recovered the hand-labelled episodes (16 of 16 across four
    recordings, one false positive in the region stated to contain none). The
    ``_pct`` form is that value's rank within the file, 0-100, so ``min: 90``
    means "the top tenth of this recording" whatever its mastering. It finds
    *episodes*; it does not judge them — see the caveat below.

``waveform_peak_density``, ``waveform_peak_density_pct``
    How many level peaks fall within 20 seconds of this one.

    **Not the arrows on the AUDIO WAVEFORM row**, despite the name and despite
    what this said before. Those are drawn from 1000 bins for the whole file;
    this is measured at 10 Hz and finds 5-12 times as many peaks. With
    suppression at one second a 20 s window holds at most 20, so ``min: 10``
    means half the seconds carry a peak — sustained level, not spikiness. A
    short burst between quiet stretches scores low, and a steady moderate
    passage scores high with no arrow in sight.

    Measured against 17 spans hand-marked as spontaneous and 5 as performed:
    AUC 0.84 on the raw count. At ``min: 10`` it keeps 15 of the 17 and cuts 4
    of the 5.

    Prefer the raw ``waveform_peak_density`` to the ``_pct`` form here — it
    measured better (0.84 against 0.75), which is the opposite of every other
    signal in this list and is explained in ``vocal_signals.peak_density_curve``.
    Read that before relying on it: the advantage comes from a file-level
    difference in peak rate that may be production style rather than
    performance. And five negatives is few enough that only the first digit of
    "4 of 5" means anything. A filter, not a verdict.

``expression``
    The expression reading for the second, as a label. Only the clearest face
    in each second, which is ``face_scan``'s reduction, not one made here.

Nothing in this list is specific to any subject matter, and none of it decides
what a combination means. A rule names the signals, sets the thresholds and
supplies the event name; all three are the user's.

**What these do not measure.** Density finds sustained, concentrated vocal
episodes, and it finds them whether or not they are spontaneous. Tested against
labels on a recording described as containing one genuine episode and otherwise
performance, it returned twenty — which is the right answer to "where are the
episodes" and the wrong answer to any question about authenticity. Nothing here
distinguishes the two, and a rule built on these signals should not be named or
described as though it does.

Cost
----

The vocal measurement decodes the audio and runs an FFT per second — tens of
seconds on a feature-length file, which is fine once and much too slow for a
loop where the point is to edit a rule and see the result. It is therefore
cached beside the analysis cache and keyed by the video's size and mtime, so
re-applying rules pays for it once.
