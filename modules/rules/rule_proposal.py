"""Turn "nothing was watching for that" into a rule that would watch for it.

:mod:`modules.report.vocabulary_gap` can say that a stretch talks about something no
class covers. The next question is always the same -- *so what would I add?* --
and answering it takes exactly the thing the rest of this report refuses to do:
deciding what a word means and which detections would stand for it. That is a
judgement, so it is a model's job, and it is the user's decision whether to keep
it.

Hence the shape here. A model proposes; this module *validates*; a human
approves; only then is anything written. Each of those three is load-bearing:

**Validation is not politeness.** The failure that costs the user most is a rule
naming a class the detector never emits. It parses, it loads, it fires on
nothing, and the only symptom is a re-run -- minutes to hours -- that changes
nothing. So a proposal referencing an unobserved class is rejected here rather
than written and discovered later.

**Approval is required.** The composition rules are the user's own file, in the
user's own vocabulary, deliberately outside version control. Nothing in this
module writes without being called with a proposal a person has seen; there is
no "apply automatically" path to turn on later, and adding one would be a change
of kind rather than of degree.

**What was proposed is recorded.** :func:`apply` leaves a note beside the video
saying which rule was added and which spoken claim it was meant to test. The
next run's report picks that note up, so the run that finally has the signal can
say whether it fired -- which is the only reason any of this was worth doing.
The alternative is a user who adds a rule, waits, and then has to remember what
question they were asking.

Nothing in this file knows any subject matter. It is handed a list of class
names the detector produced in this video, and every rule it will accept is
built from those.
