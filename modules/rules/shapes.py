"""Geometry for composition rules: boxes, and the outlines inside them.

A rule used to ask one question: is the centre of this box inside that box?
Boxes are what the detector gives, and for upright, compact things they are
close enough. They are wrong in the ways that matter most for composition:

* a person reaching sideways has a box twice their width, mostly empty, and
  anything in the empty part is "inside the person";
* two diagonal things (a bat, a leaning board) have boxes that overlap
  heavily while the things themselves never touch;
* "touching" cannot be said at all: two boxes that share an edge may hold
  things a metre apart.

An outline (a polygon, normalised to the frame like the boxes) answers all
three. This module holds the relations, working on either: a detection
without an outline is its box as a four-point polygon, so rules written for
boxes keep working unchanged, and an outline, where one exists, makes the same
rule more exact.

Relations
---------
``inside``   (default) the source's centre lies inside the region.
             Box-and-box is the engine's original test, bit for bit.
``overlaps`` at least ``min_overlap`` of the source's area lies inside the
             region (0.5 = mostly inside).
``touches``  the two shapes meet, or come within ``max_gap`` (a fraction of
             the frame width) of each other.

Areas are measured by drawing both shapes onto a small grid fitted around
them, so precision follows the objects' size rather than the frame's: no
geometry library, and a polygon from any mask tracer works as it comes.
