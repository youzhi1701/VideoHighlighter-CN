"""
auto_pipeline.py — card in, film out, as one resumable operation.

Why this exists
===============
Every piece of the journey from a camera card to a finished film already exists
somewhere in this repo: :mod:`modules.media.gopro_ingest` copies footage off a card,
``pipeline.run_highlighter`` scores a video and cuts the good parts,
:mod:`modules.media.combine_videos` joins clips into a reel, and
:mod:`modules.media.music_track` lays music over the result. What did not exist is
anything that runs them *in order* and survives being interrupted.

That matters more than it sounds. The full sequence over a 4 GB card is tens of
minutes of mostly-unattended work, and the expensive middle (detection over
every frame of every clip) is the part most likely to be interrupted — a
cancel, a crash in a native detector, a laptop lid. Re-running from the top
each time makes the tool unusable for its actual purpose. So every stage here
records what it produced, and a re-run skips whatever is already on disk.

Design
======
The pipeline is a list of named stages with an explicit state file
(``job.json``) next to the output. A stage is skipped when its recorded outputs
still exist, which makes ``resume`` the default rather than a special mode.
State is written after *every* stage transition, because the failure this
protects against is precisely the one where the process does not get to run its
cleanup.

Stages are deliberately coarse — ingest, music, highlight, combine, score —
because that is the granularity at which a user thinks about the work and at
which re-running is cheap enough to be honest. Finer resume points inside
detection belong to the engine's own caches, which already exist.

Heavy imports (the engine, which drags in torch) are deferred into the stage
that needs them, so this module stays importable — and testable — in an
environment with none of that installed. ``highlight_runner`` exists for the
same reason: tests inject a stub instead of running real detection.

Nothing here re-implements engine behaviour. If a stage looks like it is making
an editorial decision, it is passing the decision to the module that owns it.

    """Fold a :class:`modules.segments.script_plan.Script` into an engine config dict.

    The engine is driven by a flat config (the same one the Qt GUI and the
    sidecar build), so a script has to be expressed in that vocabulary rather
    than as a parallel control path. What survives the translation is what the
    engine can actually act on: the union of every beat's match terms becomes
    the interest lists, and the script's total becomes the duration budget.

    What deliberately does *not* survive is per-beat ordering and per-beat
    duration. The current selector ranks the whole video globally and has no
    notion of "this clip belongs to beat 3", so pretending otherwise here would
    produce a config that looks like it honours the script and does not. Those
    directives are carried by ``compile_directives`` for the caller that can
    use them; see docs/AUTO-PIPELINE.md.

    The input config is not mutated — callers reuse it across runs.
