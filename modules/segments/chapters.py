"""Cut a whole video into contiguous chapters, using its own shot structure.

Highlight selection picks a *sparse ranked* handful of moments and lets the rest
of the video fall away. A chapter list is the opposite shape: an exhaustive
partition where every second belongs to exactly one chapter, in order, with no
gaps and no ranking. None of the region-merging in ``modules/segments/auto_segments.py``
applies, so this is a parallel path over the same signals rather than a mode of
that one.

The method, and why it is this one
----------------------------------

The obvious approach -- Foote novelty on the per-second CLIP embeddings -- fails
badly on edited video, and the way it fails is instructive. A dialogue exchange
cuts between two faces every two seconds. Per-second novelty therefore spikes at
every one of those cuts, dozens of times, inside what any viewer would call a
single scene. The signal is real; it is just measuring shot changes, and shot
changes are not chapter changes.

Two corrections turn it into something that works:

**Boundaries can only fall on real cuts.** A chapter never begins mid-shot, so
the candidate set is the video's own scene list rather than every second. On a
feature film that is a few thousand candidates instead of a few hundred
thousand, and every one of them is a place a boundary could legitimately go.
This is why having scene detection already makes movies *easier* than the
unstructured case, not harder.

**Comparison happens between runs of shots, not across a single cut.** Each shot
is collapsed to one signature vector (the mean of its sampled seconds), and a
candidate cut is scored by how unlike the previous ``W`` shots the next ``W``
shots are. Shot-reverse-shot averages out inside such a window -- alternating
between two faces has a stable mean -- so the dialogue scene reads as one
plateau, and the score only rises where the footage genuinely stops looking like
what came before: a new location, a new palette, a new set of faces.

That is a checkerboard kernel evaluated on a shot lattice instead of a time
lattice, which is the whole trick.

Signals are optional, and it degrades in a defined order
--------------------------------------------------------

Visual signatures need the CLIP index, which needs the optional OpenVINO stack.
When embeddings are unavailable the same operators run on whatever else the
caller passes -- an audio quiet-gap curve, per-second motion -- and failing
everything, ``chapterize`` falls back to grouping shots into runs of roughly the
target length. The result is always a valid partition; only its reasons get
weaker, and ``method`` on each chapter records which one applied.

Naming
------

Nothing here invents chapter titles. A vector is a point, not a name, and this
repo does not ship a built-in vocabulary to match points against. What each
chapter carries instead is measured description -- how long it runs, how many
shots, how fast it cuts, and how far it sits from the video's own average look.
Callers that *do* have a vocabulary (user-taught categories, a transcript) can
label the partition afterwards; the partition does not depend on them.

Everything below the embeddings is numpy over small arrays, so the logic that
decides what the user sees is testable on synthetic input in milliseconds -- see
``tests/test_chapters.py``. ``chapterize`` returns plain lists and dicts, so the
result is JSON-serialisable and can cross a thread boundary into Qt untouched.
