"""
reel_plan.py — arrange clips into a short-form reel that tells a story.

Why this exists
===============
The highlight engine answers "which moments scored highest". A reel needs a
different question answered: "what happens first, what happens next, and how
long does each thing stay on screen". Those are not the same, and the gap
between them is why a montage of genuinely good moments can still be dull —
it opens on whatever happened first, holds every shot the same length, and
stops rather than ends.

So this module does three things the scorer cannot:

**Structure.** A reel is four sections, not a list. The hook (the opening
seconds) has to be the most striking thing you have, not the earliest. Context
establishes where and what. Escalation is the body and takes most of the
running time. The payoff ends it, and is held longer than anything else because
an ending that cuts away at the same rhythm as the middle does not read as an
ending.

**Pace.** Shot length is the main lever on how a reel feels, and the useful
range is much shorter than a highlight reel's: 1–2.5 s for energetic material
against the 6 s the engine happily produces. Within a reel the pace also moves
— faster through escalation, slower on the payoff — because uniform pacing is
what makes an edit feel machine-made.

**Order.** Everything after the hook stays in the order it was shot. Progression
is what makes a sequence read as a story rather than as a shuffle, and shooting
order is the only progression the footage actually carries.

What it does not do
===================
It does not judge which moment is most striking. It takes scores if the caller
has them and otherwise uses shooting order, because inventing a notion of
"interesting" here would duplicate — and quietly disagree with — the scoring
the engine already did.

      still and pressing record twice is the commonest way a reel repeats
      itself, and no amount of picking better moments fixes it, because the
      moments are genuinely good and genuinely of the same thing. It is first
      because it is the coarsest — with more places than shots every candidate
      scores zero here and the preferences below do all the work, and it only
      speaks up to break a tie against showing the same view again.
    - **Not the same spot as the shot before it**, for when there are fewer
      places than shots and something has to be repeated. Repeating a view
      later is a montage; repeating it immediately is a mistake.
    - **Not the same picture as the shot before it.** Position cannot catch a
      landmark filmed from half a kilometre away — by position those are
      different places, which they are, and the viewer still sees the same
      lake twice. So the two are compared directly, and only against the

    - **Not the same framing as the shot before it.** This is the one that

    highest becomes the hook. ``texts`` maps a section name to a line of
    on-screen text ("Hook" is the one that matters, since most viewers start
    watching muted).

    ``analysis`` is a :class:`modules.audio.music_analysis.MusicAnalysis`; with
    ``quantise`` the shot lengths are rounded to a musical unit chosen to suit
    them — the beat rather than the bar, because at 66 BPM a bar is 3.6 s and
    an energetic reel wants shots half that long.

    ``settle`` decides where inside each clip a shot begins. On (the default)
    every source is measured by :mod:`modules.segments.shot_window` and each shot takes
    the best window it can still reach, rather than starting at frame zero —
    which is where the camera is very often still being raised or pulled out.
    Off, and shots begin at the first unused frame as they always did.
    ``windows`` accepts an already-measured ``{path: ClipWindows}`` so a caller
    that has paid for the measurement does not pay twice.

    ``spread`` keeps the reel off the same view twice. Clips are grouped by
    where and when they were shot (see :mod:`modules.segments.shot_place`) and the reel
    takes one shot per spot before it reuses any — which is what stops four
    shots of one valley, filmed over ten minutes of standing still, all
    reaching the same edit. ``track`` optionally names a GPX file, used to
    place clips whose own metadata carries no GPS; ``places`` accepts an
    already-computed ``{path: place number}``.

    Everything after the hook keeps the order it was given, which is shooting
    order when the caller passes the engine's output unchanged. Settling moves
    the in-*point* of a shot, never its place in the running order: what makes
    a sequence read as a story is the progression, and reordering by picture
    quality would trade the story for a slightly cleaner frame.
