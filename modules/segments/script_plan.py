"""
script_plan.py — the film the user asked for, written where the cutter can read it.

Why this exists
===============
The selector scores every second and greedily takes the best of them
(``modules.segments.highlight_select``). That answers "which were the strongest
moments", which is the right question for a highlights reel and the wrong one
for a film. It cannot express intent — *open with ten seconds of establishing
shots, then three action beats of about eight seconds each, close on something
calm* — because what is being described is a **sequence of different requests**,
not one request with better numbers. No arrangement of sliders says it.

A script says it in one file. Each beat carries its own length, its own match
terms and its own ordering; :func:`compile_directives` flattens the beats into
one selection request per clip. The selector therefore keeps knowing nothing
about scripts, and the script keeps knowing nothing about scoring — the two
meet at :class:`CutDirective` and nowhere else.

Being a file is half the value. A slider setting exists only in the moment it
is dragged; a script is reviewable, diffable and re-runnable. Change one beat's
duration, run again, compare the two cuts, keep the better file.

Why unknown keys are fatal
==========================
Writing ``durations:`` instead of ``duration:`` is a thirty-second mistake that
costs an hour when the parser ignores it: the run completes, the cut is wrong
in a way that looks like the *engine* misbehaving, and the file that would
explain it reads as correct. So every key is checked against a known set and an
unrecognised one stops the parse, with the line number and the nearest legal
spelling. The same reasoning covers duplicate keys, unknown ``order`` values,
and a scalar where a list belongs: anything a person could plausibly typo is
rejected loudly rather than dropped quietly.

:func:`validate_script` is the other half of that split. Parsing answers "can
this be executed at all" and its failures must stop the run; validation answers
"will executing it disappoint", which is a judgement — and a judgement must
never be the reason a render does not happen.

The format
==========
YAML, because the repo already carries PyYAML and ``config.yaml`` established
the vocabulary. Hand-writable is the requirement it is designed against::

    title: My Film
    music: D:\\music\\track.mp3     # optional
    snap_to_beat: true              # optional
    total_duration: 180             # optional overall target, seconds
    beats:
      - name: Establishing
        duration: 12                # or [8, 15] for a min/max range
        match:
          objects: []               # user-supplied terms, all optional
          actions: []
          keywords: []
        sources: []                 # optional: only cut from these files
        order: chronological        # chronological | best_first (default)
      - name: Action
        repeat: 3                   # this beat contributes 3 clips
        duration: [6, 10]

Every match term is the user's own, typed at runtime. This module ships no
category lists, no presets and no vocabulary of its own: it matches whatever it
is given and holds no opinion about what that is.
