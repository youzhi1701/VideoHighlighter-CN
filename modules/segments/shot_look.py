shot_look.py — do two clips look the same, closely enough to not sit together.

Why this exists
===============
:mod:`modules.segments.shot_place` stops a reel using one *spot* twice, and that fixes
the commonest repetition: standing still and pressing record. It cannot fix the
other one. A landmark is visible from a long way off, so two clips filmed five
hundred metres apart can both be of the same lake, and by position they are
plainly different places — which they are. The viewer does not care where the
camera was. They see the same picture twice.

So this compares the pictures. It is deliberately the *last* thing tried rather
than the first, because on the footage this was built for it very nearly does
not work at all.

Why the obvious version fails
=============================
On a shoot that is one colour — a moor, a beach, a snowfield — a single
descriptor cannot tell "the same view" from "the same kind of view". Measured
against known pairs on a real shoot, each of these was tried on its own and
each failed:

- a coarse colour signature called thirty of sixty-six pairs near-duplicates;
- a perceptual hash, a normalised greyscale layout at three resolutions, an
  HSV histogram and ORB feature matching each ranked at most one of four known
  pairs into their top four.

The colour histogram's worst false positive was two shots of a footpath at
0.966 — more similar, it said, than the two shots of the same reservoir. The
greyscale layout's worst was a hillside against a hazy moor at 0.882.

What works, and how little of it
===============================
The two descriptors fail on different pairs, so the smaller of the two is high
only when the layout and the palette both match — which is close to what a
person means by "that is the same shot again".

How well that works was measured over all two hundred and ten pairs of a
twenty-one clip shoot, against pairs marked by hand as repeats. It is worth
being blunt about the answer, because it decides what this module is allowed
to be used for:

===========  ==================  ===================
Threshold    repeats it finds    pairs it invents
===========  ==================  ===================
0.88         1 of 8              0
0.86         1 of 8              5
0.84         2 of 8              7
0.80         3 of 8              13
===========  ==================  ===================

Below the default the false pairs arrive faster than the true ones. Only the
single clearest repeat is separated from the field at all — two shots of one
reservoir at 0.906, against 0.879 for the next pair, which is of two different
things. The rest of the repeats a person would name sit at 0.79 and below,
mixed in with pairs that share nothing but a hillside.

So the claim here is deliberately small: **this finds the one or two shots in
a reel that are nearly the same picture, and nothing subtler.** It is used to
stop those sitting next to each other and for nothing else — not to drop a
clip, not to rank a reel. Repetition that position can see belongs to
:mod:`modules.segments.shot_place`, which is exact; this covers only the case position
is blind to, and covers it partially.

Position and appearance are genuinely independent, which is why both exist:
two clips filmed eleven metres apart score 0.217 here, because the camera was
pointed the other way.
