"""
shot_place.py — when and where a clip was taken, and which clips share a spot.

Why this exists
===============
A reel that shows the same view three times reads as one shot with hiccups,
and no amount of picking better *moments* fixes it, because the moments really
are good — they are just of the same thing. :mod:`modules.segments.shot_type` knows how
a clip is framed and :mod:`modules.segments.shot_window` knows which seconds of it are
steady. Neither has any way to notice that four of them are the same valley.

Measured on a real shoot, that is exactly what goes wrong: of twelve shots in a
reel, four *pairs* had been filmed from within 130 m of each other, three of
those pairs less than twenty seconds apart. Standing still and pressing record
twice is the single most common way a montage repeats itself.

Why not compare the pictures
============================
The obvious approach is to measure how similar two clips look, and it was tried
first. On a shoot that is one colour — a moor, a beach, a ski slope — it does
not work. A coarse colour signature called thirty of sixty-six pairs
near-duplicates; a perceptual hash, a normalised greyscale layout, an HSV
histogram and ORB feature matching were each checked against known-identical
pairs and none of them separated those from the rest. "The same lake from a
different angle" is a judgement about the world, and the pixels genuinely do
not carry it on footage where everything is green.

Where the camera was, on the other hand, is a fact, and it is already written
down. So this measures position and time and leaves the pictures alone.

Where the answer comes from
===========================
Three sources, in order of how much they can be trusted:

1. **The clip's own location tag.** Exact, and present on rather less footage
   than you would hope — on the shoot above, thirteen of twenty-one source
   files had one and the derived highlight clips had almost none.
2. **A GPS track**, if the caller supplies one. Any watch or phone that can
   export GPX will do; the clip's timestamp is looked up against the track.
   This is what fills in the other eight.
3. **Time alone.** Always available, and enough on its own for the case that
   matters most: two clips a few seconds apart are the same spot whatever
   else is true.

Timestamps
==========
The recording time lives on the *source* file. A clip that has been through the
engine is a re-encode and has lost it — ffmpeg writes its own tags — so a
``..._highlight.mp4`` is traced back to the file it came from before being
asked. Failing that, the file's own modification time stands in, which is
right often enough to be worth having and wrong often enough not to be trusted
over a real tag.
