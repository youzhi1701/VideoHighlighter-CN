shot_type.py — what kind of shot is this, in framing terms.

Why this exists
===============
The scorer ranks moments. It has no idea that half a shoot is the camera
pointed back at the person carrying it and the other half is what they were
looking at — and an edit that does not know the difference cuts six selfies
together and then six landscapes, which reads as two edits stuck end to end.
Alternating them is most of what makes a sequence feel arranged.

So this measures *framing*, not subject matter: how much of the frame a face
occupies, how much the picture moves, how bright and how sharp it is. A shot
where a face fills a good share of the frame is a close shot whoever is in it;
a shot with no face is a wide one whatever it is of. The module holds no
opinion about content and its categories describe the camera, which is the
distinction that survives being pointed at anything.

Why these signals
=================
**Face fraction** separates a held-at-arm's-length shot from a person standing
in a landscape far better than face *presence* does — on a wide action-camera
lens a distant figure and a selfie both "have a face", and only the size tells
them apart.

**Motion** is measured between sampled frames rather than within them, so it
reflects how much the shot changes rather than how fast anything in it moves.
That is the property an editor cares about when deciding what can sit next to
what.

**Sharpness** (variance of Laplacian) catches the shots that look wrong on a
big screen for reasons nobody articulates. It is reported rather than acted on
here; the caller decides whether softness disqualifies a shot.

Sampling
========
Frames are read at even intervals rather than decoded in full: eight frames
answer "what kind of shot is this" as well as eight hundred, and the whole
point is to classify a folder of clips in seconds rather than minutes. Results
cache next to the clip, keyed on size and mtime, because this runs every time
a reel is planned.
