"""
shot_window.py — which part of a clip is worth putting on screen.

Why this exists
===============
Every other stage answers "which clips". None of them answers "which *seconds*
of the clip", and the reel planner had no way to ask: it started each shot at
the beginning of its source and took the length the pace called for. On real
footage that is the wrong second to start on more often than not. A shot begins
while the camera is still being pulled out of a pocket, raised onto a mount, or
swung round to point at the thing — and the reel opens on a blurred lurch that
settles just as the cut ends.

The clip is not bad. Its *first* seconds are, and the fix is to start later
rather than to throw the clip away.

What "settled" means here
=========================
Not "still" — an action camera is never still, and a reel of static shots is
its own kind of dead. What separates a shot being *carried* from a shot being
*used* is whether the frame-to-frame movement is coherent:

**Coherence** is the response of a phase correlation between consecutive
frames: how well one frame explains the next as a rigid shift of the whole
picture. A camera on a mount panning fast still scores high — the picture moves
as one. A camera in a hand being repositioned does not, because the lens is
also rotating, the exposure is chasing, and half the frame is something that
was not in shot a moment ago. Measured on a real shoot this is the signal that
separates the two states cleanly: the same clip runs 0.03–0.35 while the camera
is being placed and 0.85–0.99 once it is.

**Jerk** — how much the movement itself changes between samples — catches what
coherence alone does not. A deliberate pan has a nearly constant shift; a hand
searching for framing changes direction constantly.

**Sharpness** is measured against the clip's own upper range rather than an
absolute, because the variance of a Laplacian depends as much on what is in
front of the lens as on the focus. Half a stop of motion blur reads as a large
drop *within one clip* and as nothing at all across a folder.

**Exposure drift** catches the auto-exposure ramp that follows a camera coming
out of a bag into daylight. The picture is sharp and steady and still visibly
wrong for a second and a half.

None of these is decisive alone, so the score is a weighted mean pulled down
towards its worst term: a window that is perfect except that a hand crosses the
lens is not a good window, and averaging alone would say it was.

What it does not do
===================
It has no opinion on whether the content is interesting — that is the scorer's
job, and second-guessing it here would mean two parts of the program quietly
disagreeing about what a highlight is. This only says which seconds are
*usable*, which is a property of the camera rather than of the subject.
