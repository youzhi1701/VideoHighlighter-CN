"""Which accelerator to use, chosen by name and carried to every process.

The app picks a backend on its own — CUDA, then Intel, then DirectML, then the
processor — and that order is right for almost everybody. It is not testable by
the person holding the machine, though: to find out whether DirectML beats
OpenVINO on a particular card you have to be able to *ask* for it, and until
now the only way to ask was an environment variable that a shortcut-launched
app never sees.

So: a named choice, saved in ``config.yaml`` under ``compute.backend``, and
published into the environment at startup.

**The environment rather than a Python variable**, because object detection can
run in worker *processes*. They re-execute the app's entry point and inherit
the environment and nothing else, so a process-level override would apply to
the window and quietly not to the work.

**A preference rather than a command.** A backend that is not available on this
machine logs why and falls back to the automatic order. A config file copied
between machines, or a card that was swapped out, should cost a line in the log
rather than a run that refuses to start.
