"""
cuda_check.py — can this PyTorch actually run on this NVIDIA card?

``torch.cuda.is_available()`` answers whether a driver and a device exist, not
whether this build of torch carries GPU code for that device. A card newer
than the build — an RTX 50-series (compute capability 12.0) under a CUDA 12.4
wheel, whose kernels stop at 9.0 — is "available", and the first real
operation on it fails with "no kernel image is available for execution on the
device". Every consumer then fails or quietly returns nothing, on a machine
that would have run fine on the processor.

``cuda_unusable_reason`` asks the question properly: the build's own
compatibility rule first (no CUDA context needed, so an incompatible card is
never touched), then one tiny operation on the card, the only real proof that
kernels run. Imports nothing at module scope; the answer is cached per process.
