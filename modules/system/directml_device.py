==========================
Experimental DirectML backend, so an AMD card is not automatically a CPU-only
machine.

Why DirectML and not ROCm
-------------------------
ROCm is the vendor's own stack and it is faster, but it is Linux-first and AMD
dropped consumer GPUs from it early: Polaris (RX 470/570/580) has had no
support since ROCm 4.5, and the Windows HIP SDK reports "no ROCm-capable
device detected" on exactly the cards most likely to be sitting in a machine
that would benefit. ZLUDA (CUDA-on-AMD translation) is the other option and is
a dependency maze. Requiring either would mean telling an AMD user to install
Linux to use this app, which is not a real answer.

DirectML is Microsoft's compute backend on top of DirectX 12, so it works on
anything with a DX12 driver -- every AMD GPU since Polaris, plus Intel and
NVIDIA -- on stock Windows, with no vendor SDK. It is slower than CUDA/ROCm and
its operator coverage is a subset of torch's, which is why everything here is
switchable and every consumer keeps its existing fallback.

Licensing: ``torch-directml`` is MIT and is **not** in ``requirements.txt``
and **not** in the frozen build. A user who wants it installs it themselves.
That is deliberate -- see "The install is destructive" below -- and it also
keeps the shipped bundle free of a dependency we have not audited for
redistribution.

The install is destructive, which is why this is opt-in
-------------------------------------------------------
``torch-directml`` pins an exact ``torch`` version and pip will happily satisfy
that by *replacing* whatever torch is installed. On a machine with a ``+xpu``
or ``+cu128`` build that silently removes Arc or CUDA support, and the app then
looks broken for an unrelated reason. So DirectML must never be a hard
requirement, must never be installed as a side effect of anything, and belongs
in its own virtualenv on a machine that also has another accelerator.

The version strings are also a trap: there is no ``torch-directml>=1.13``.
Releases are dated dev builds (``0.2.5.dev240914``), so a requirement pin with
a normal-looking floor resolves to nothing at all.

What this module does and does not decide
-----------------------------------------
It answers "is there a usable DirectML device, and what is torch's name for
it". It does not decide policy: :func:`mode` reads the opt-in, and each caller
decides whether DirectML is appropriate for *its* model. Nothing here imports
torch at module scope, so it stays free to be imported during preflight.

Never raises. A probe that throws is a probe that costs somebody their GPU.
