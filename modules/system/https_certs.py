"""A certificate store the packaged app can actually find.

Python verifies HTTPS against the platform's trust store, and on macOS it does
not read the Keychain: it reads an OpenSSL directory that a stock python.org
build populates with the `Install Certificates.command` script. A frozen app
runs that build without ever running that script, so every HTTPS call fails
with::

    <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed:
    unable to get local issuer certificate>

Observed on the 0.11.0 macOS build: the update check failed at launch and the
app reported "no manifest", which reads as "you are up to date" and is not the
same thing at all.

`certifi` ships Mozilla's CA bundle as a file inside the bundle, which sidesteps
the platform store entirely. It is already present — `requests` depends on it —
and PyInstaller's stock hook collects its `cacert.pem`.

Windows is unaffected (Python reads the system store there), so this is a
fallback rather than a replacement: when certifi is missing, callers get None
and urllib's default behaviour, which is what they had.
