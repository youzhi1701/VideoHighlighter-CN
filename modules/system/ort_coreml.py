"""ONNX Runtime's Core ML execution provider — the Mac's GPU for the models
that already run through ONNX Runtime.

A Mac has no CUDA, and OpenVINO on macOS has a CPU plugin only, so until now a
Mac ran every model on the processor. The plain ``onnxruntime`` wheel for macOS
ships Apple's Core ML provider, and Core ML is what runs a model on the Apple
GPU (through Metal) or the Neural Engine. The two models that already have an
ONNX path for AMD cards — YOLOX detection and R3D action recognition — can take
it unchanged: :mod:`modules.system.ort_directml` hands out this provider instead
of DirectML when the process is on macOS, and everything downstream of it is
the same code.

What this module is
-------------------
The Mac-specific settings and nothing else: the switch, which compute units
Core ML may use, and the provider options built from them. The probe and the
session factory stay in ``ort_directml`` so a caller asks one module "can ONNX
Runtime reach the GPU here" on every platform.

Switches, both read on every call so a worker process decides for itself:

* ``VH_COREML=off`` — keep ONNX Runtime on the processor. For comparing a run
  with and without it, and for backing out if Core ML misbehaves on a machine.
* ``VH_COREML_UNITS`` — which silicon Core ML may use: ``all`` (the default:
  Core ML picks between GPU, Neural Engine and CPU per layer), ``gpu`` (GPU and
  CPU only, i.e. Metal), ``ane`` (Neural Engine and CPU), ``cpu``.

No model cache directory is set, deliberately. Core ML compiles a model when a
session opens, and ONNX Runtime can keep the compiled result — but it keys that
cache by the model's *path*, and the R3D export is rewritten in place when the
weights behind it change. A stale compiled model would run the old weights
without a word. Compiling each time costs a few seconds per session; wrong
answers cost more.
