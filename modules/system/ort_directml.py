"""ONNX Runtime's DirectML execution provider — the GPU path a packaged build
can actually ship.

``torch-directml`` cannot be bundled. It pins an exact torch (2.4.1 for the
current release) and pip satisfies that by *replacing* whatever torch is
installed, so a build carrying it could not also carry the CUDA torch the
NVIDIA path needs — one process, one torch. That is why
``modules/system/directml_device.py`` is opt-in and source-only, and why an AMD user
running the exe gets the processor.

ONNX Runtime has no such coupling. ``onnxruntime-directml`` declares no torch
dependency at all, so the same build can hold CUDA torch *and* a DirectML-
capable runtime beside it, and route a model to whichever one the machine can
use. The model format is the common denominator, not the framework — the same
arrangement AnimeJaNai ships (TensorRT for NVIDIA, DirectML for AMD/Intel, one
release, ONNX models).

What this module is
-------------------
The provider probe and the session factory, and nothing else. It answers "can
this machine run an ONNX model on its GPU, and why not" in the same shape
``directml_device`` answers it for torch, so a caller can ask both without
learning two idioms. :mod:`modules.vision.onnx_detector` is the first consumer.

**One onnxruntime, ever.** ``onnxruntime``, ``onnxruntime-gpu`` and
``onnxruntime-directml`` all install the same ``onnxruntime`` package and
overwrite each other. Only the DirectML one belongs in ``requirements.txt``:
NVIDIA already has torch+CUDA and Intel has OpenVINO, so a second accelerated
ORT build would buy nothing and break the one that matters.

The user's switch is shared with the torch backend: ``VH_DIRECTML=off`` turns
off DirectML, whichever runtime would have provided it.

On macOS the same probe and factory hand out Apple's Core ML provider instead
(:mod:`modules.system.ort_coreml`), which runs a model on the Apple GPU or
Neural Engine. The plain ``onnxruntime`` wheel carries it there, the models and
their pre- and post-processing are the same, and so is every caller: "can ONNX
Runtime reach the GPU here" has one answer per platform, and this module gives
it. ``VH_COREML=off`` is the Mac's switch.
