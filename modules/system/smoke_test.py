"""`--smoke-test <video>`: the packaged app's riskiest paths, with no window.

Nobody on the project has a Mac, so the first person to run a mac build was a
tester — and the build took his machine down. Every multiprocessing child had
loaded the whole app (freeze_support() sat below the heavy imports), object
detection starts six of them, and the memory ran out. None of that needs a
screen to see. CI runs this against the built .app on a macOS runner:

    VideoHighlighter --smoke-test clip.mp4 --smoke-report report.json

and it checks what hurt the tester, in the frozen binary itself:

* the app gets through its imports, and ``pipeline`` imports (the 0.11.0 crash
  was an import: ultralytics → matplotlib → the macOS font list);
* a spawned child does not load the app — it is asked what it imported;
* object detection runs its workers, and the whole process tree stays under a
  memory ceiling — past it the tree is killed, so a runaway fails the job
  instead of the runner;
* where ONNX Runtime has the GPU (Core ML on a Mac), the stock detector loads
  there and answers a frame;
* the thumbnail decoder child starts and answers;
* a child does not rotate the parent's debug.log away.

Exit code 0 when every check passed, 1 when one failed. The report is JSON so
the workflow can upload it with the logs.
