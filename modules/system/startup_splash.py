"""The logo while you wait, and an honest line about what is being loaded.

Two things are slow enough to need it: launching the app (dominated by the
import phase in a frozen build) and opening the timeline viewer (~6s of widget
construction, most of it the signal timeline and the assistant panel). Both
block the GUI thread, so without this the window simply is not there yet and
the app looks hung.

There are two surfaces, because no single one covers the whole launch:

``pyi_splash``
    PyInstaller's native splash, drawn by the bootloader *before* Python
    starts. It is the only thing that can cover the import phase — by the time
    any of our code runs, the slowest part of an exe launch is already over.
    Needs ``--splash`` at build time; absent from a source run. **Image only:**
    the ``--splash`` CLI flag hardcodes ``text_pos=None``, which disables the
    text overlay entirely, so ``update_text`` is accepted and silently drawn
    nowhere. The calls below are kept because they cost nothing and start
    working the day the build moves to a .spec that sets ``text_pos`` — until
    then, stage() during the import phase is a debug.log timing and no more.

``begin()`` / ``stage()`` / ``finish()``
    A Qt panel with the logo, a stage line and a step bar, for everything
    after Qt exists. Also used on its own for the timeline viewer.

``stage()`` drives whichever of the two is live, so callers never branch. It is
a no-op when neither is — that is what lets `signal_timeline_viewer` report its
own progress without knowing whether anyone is watching, and without importing
this module's Qt half at all.

**Qt is imported lazily, on the first `begin()`.** Importing this module has to
stay free of it: `main.py` reports progress from before it has imported Qt
itself, and the order it imports things in on Windows is deliberate.
