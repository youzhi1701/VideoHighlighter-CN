"""Let the user set the interface size, before Qt decides it for them.

Qt takes the display's scale factor from the OS, and Windows picks that from
the monitor's size and pixel density. On a 55" 4K panel used as a monitor it
lands at 150% or 200%, which is right for a television at three metres and
enormous for an app at desk distance. Nothing in the app could override it: the
scale factor is read once, when the QApplication is constructed, and after that
nothing can change it.

So this runs *before* that, and sets ``QT_SCALE_FACTOR`` — the multiplier Qt
applies on top of whatever the OS said. 0.75 on a 200% display gives an
interface at 150%, and every widget, font and icon follows, because it is the
same mechanism the display scale itself uses.

Where the value comes from, first match winning:

``VH_UI_SCALE``
    An environment variable, for trying a number without touching a file.
``ui_scale`` in ``config.yaml``
    For keeping it.

Absent from both, nothing is set and Qt behaves exactly as before.
