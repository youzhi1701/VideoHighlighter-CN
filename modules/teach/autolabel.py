"""Decide the obvious samples without a review, and keep checking that it is right.

Reviewing every sample is what made teaching slow. Most samples are not in
doubt: once a class has a handful of checked examples, a sample that looks as
much like them as they look like each other, and like nothing else, is that
class. Auto-accept decides those, and review is left with the doubtful ones.

Three things keep it honest, because a label nobody looked at is only as good
as the rule that made it:

* **It starts late.** A class is auto-accepted only once it has
  ``auto_min_checked`` samples a person accepted (examples count). Before that,
  its prototype is the class *name*, and CLIP's reading of a name is not
  something to train on unchecked.
* **It is spot-checked.** Every review sheet carries some auto-accepted
  samples (``review.pick_batch``). What auto said is kept on the sample
  (``auto_label``), so each check is scored: agreed or overturned. If more
  than ``auto_max_error`` of a class's checks are overturned, auto-accept stops
  for that class, and everything it accepted there unchecked goes back to
  the review queue.
* **It never judges the model.** The held-out set that scores every round is
  drawn only from samples a person decided (``build.assign_splits``), and
  class prototypes are built only from those (``sort.build_prototypes``), so
  an error cannot teach the sorter to repeat itself.

Negatives are auto-decided the same way: once a person has marked enough
"none of these", a sample below the footage's ordinary level for every class
is one more.
