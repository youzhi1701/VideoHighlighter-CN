"""Boxes for an object project: proposed, checked, or drawn in the labeller.

An accepted object sample says "it is in here somewhere". A detector needs
where. Three sources, all ending in ``labels.json``
(``modules.vision.label_store``), all reviewed the same way:

* **Proposed** (``propose``). The stock detector finds everything it can in
  a few frames of the sample; each box is cropped, embedded, and scored
  against the class; the crop that stands out wins. When the class *is* one
  of the stock detector's labels, its own boxes are taken directly. From
  round 2, the project's own detector proposes (``source="model"``).
* **Drawn** in ``tools/labeler.py`` — the manual step that gave good results
  with a hundred samples. ``labeler_worklist`` says which clips still need it;
  ``import_labeler`` reads the export back.
* **Negatives**. A sample judged "none of these" becomes a frame with no
  boxes: what stops a detector firing on everything.

Proposals start ``pending`` and reach a dataset only once accepted on a sheet
(``next_sheet``, ``apply_verdicts``): a proposed box is a question.
