"""Accepted samples -> the dataset layout training already reads.

* ``actions``: ``dataset/train/<class>/*.mp4`` and ``dataset/val/<class>/*.mp4``,
  what ``model_training.r3d`` and ``model_training.intel`` load.
* ``objects``: the COCO layout ``training.train_yolox_run`` loads, built by
  ``modules.vision.label_store.build_dataset`` from ``labels.json``.

**The held-out set is frozen.** A sample's split is decided once, the first
time it is built into a dataset, and never changes. Every round is scored on
the same held-out samples, so "round 3 beats round 2" compares like with like;
folding reviewed samples into training round after round would feel productive
and destroy the only measurement there is.

**Neighbours travel together.** Samples next to each other in one source are
near-identical, so they go to the same side (``label_store.segments``):
otherwise validation scores the model on pictures it trained on.

**Enough validation per class.** The action trainers re-split a class with
fewer than two validation clips or under 20% of its clips held out — which
would un-freeze the held-out set behind our back — so each class is given at
least that much.
