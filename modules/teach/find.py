"""Find a shown thing in every sample, as one box to confirm.

Someone draws a box around the thing once (``seed``). From then on, each
sample is searched region by region: the regions the stock detector found
plus an overlapping grid (for things no detector knows), each embedded with
CLIP once and cached. A sample's score for the class is its best region's
likeness to the class's crops, calibrated against the whole footage the way
sample scores are (``scoring.background``): 0 is ordinary footage, 1 looks
like the boxes accepted so far.

A sample that clears ``settings.gate`` gets its best region as a ``found``
box, pending. That box is the whole question: "is this box around it?".
Accepting it accepts the sample as the class (``settle``); there is no
separate sample review for a seeded class. Boxes above the class's learnt
cutoff are accepted without asking (``cutoff``).

Every accepted box sharpens the class's likeness, so ``find`` is re-run
whenever a class has more accepted crops than when it last ran; the region
vectors are cached, so that costs a matrix product, not another pass of CLIP.
