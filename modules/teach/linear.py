"""A linear layer trained on the samples a person sorted. Pure numpy.

``scoring`` compares each sample with one or a few centres per class. That is
all there is to go on when a class has a name and a handful of examples, but a
hand-sorted dataset has hundreds per class, and centres throw most of that
away: which directions in CLIP space tell two neighbouring classes apart is
something only training on both learns. Measured on one such dataset with
whole videos held out, the same CLIP vectors sorted 51% right this way against
37% by nearest centre.

The layer is multinomial logistic regression on standardised vectors, with
classes weighted by their size (a class of 300 does not drown one of 25) and an
L2 penalty. Its outputs are probabilities, and ``threshold_for`` turns "how
sure" into "how often right": the lowest probability at which held-out
predictions reach a precision, measured on samples grouped by the video they
came from so a video never vouches for itself.
