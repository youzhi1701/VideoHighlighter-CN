"""A teaching project on disk: what to find, where, and every decision so far.

Layout, all under one folder the user owns (never the repo)::

    project.json        task, classes, settings, sources, training rounds
    samples.json        one row per cut sample: scores, proposal, verdict, split
    labels.json         object boxes (modules.vision.label_store format)
    videos/             sources fetched from a URL (local files stay in place)
    samples/            cut samples, <source>__<start ms>.mp4
    focus/              the cropper's person-focused versions (actions only)
    sorted/<class>/     samples as folders, for sorting by hand
    review/             contact sheets and what each tile is
    dataset/            what training reads
    runs/<n>/           each training round

The two JSON files are the state. Everything else can be rebuilt from them and
the sources, which is what makes every step safe to re-run and a project safe
to leave half-done.

**Two tasks.** ``actions`` teaches a clip classifier (R3D, which the app's
action recognition loads); a sample's label is the whole clip. ``objects``
teaches a detector (YOLOX); a sample is a place to look, and the labels are
boxes on its frames.
