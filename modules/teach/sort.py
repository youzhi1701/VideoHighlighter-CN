"""Sort every sample into a class, the way sorter.py did for a trained model.

``sorter.py`` needs a model that already knows the classes. A project starts
without one, so round 1 sorts by CLIP (``scoring``): by the words, and by the
examples as soon as there are any. From round 2 the project's own model sorts
too, through ``sorter.py``'s classifier, and the review queue asks about the
samples where the two disagree.

The result is recorded on each sample (scores, proposal, lead), and optionally
laid out as folders, ``sorted/<class>/``, ``sorted/_unsure/``,
``sorted/_none/`` — the layout the manual process used, so sorting by hand
still works: move what is wrong, then ``review.from_folders``.
