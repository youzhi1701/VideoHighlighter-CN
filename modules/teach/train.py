"""Train a round, score it on the held-out set, install it only if it wins.

Each round trains into ``runs/<n>/``, never over the model the app is using.
Then:

* **Scored on the frozen held-out set** (``build``), so rounds compare.
  Actions report *balanced accuracy* — the mean over classes of how often the
  model names a held-out clip correctly — and per class, which is the "how
  often does it find the thing" sentence docs/CUSTOM-MODEL-TRAINING.md asks
  for. Objects report the best validation loss, the measure
  ``train_yolox_run`` has.
* **Installed only when better** than the best round installed so far
  (``should_install``), or when asked. The previous model stays in its
  ``runs/`` folder, so going back is copying it again.

Actions train in a subprocess (``model_training.r3d.train``): minutes to hours
of torch that must not take the caller down with it, and whose log is kept in
``runs/<n>/train.log``. Objects train in-process through the same functions
the Training tab uses.
