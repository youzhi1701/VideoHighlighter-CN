"""Choosing which local model writes the report, on one screen.

The report used to ask for a model with a chain of prompts — backend, then name,
then projector, then label — which is four decisions with no view of what was
already configured and no way back from the second one. The chat panel had
solved the same problem years earlier with a form: a backend, a path with a
Browse button beside it, and the fields that only matter for one backend hidden
until it is picked. This is that form, over the report's list of models.

The list is the part the chat panel does not need and the report does. Reading a
scene and advising on weights suit different models, so the question is not
"which model" once, it is "which of mine, this time" — and a list you can see is
the difference between switching and remembering what you typed last week.

The same argument applies one level down, and for a while did not hold here. The
Ollama field was free text while the panel next door filled a dropdown from the
server, so the report asked the user to remember a tag that the machine it was
about to talk to could simply be asked for. A mistyped tag is indistinguishable
from one that has not been pulled, and the failure surfaces at the end of a
generation somebody waited a minute for. Both fields now offer what is already
there — see :mod:`modules.narration.llm_discovery` — and both stay typable, because a
model being pulled right now is not a reason to refuse the name.

Where the choices come from is injected rather than imported, so the dialog
still opens in a test with no server, no settings and no network.
