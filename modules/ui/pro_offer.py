"""Mention Pro's free trial, only where the free edition actually stops.

The free edition has no caps to hit: nothing counts runs, minutes or exports.
What it has are edges -- things a user reaches for that this build does not
ship. Telling them Pro exists is useful exactly there, and noise anywhere else,
so this module names the edges and decides whether a given one may say so now.

Where it appears
----------------
Only right after the user has run into one of these:

* ``rule_unbuildable`` -- they asked for a composition rule and none came back.
  A rule arranges classes the detector produced; it cannot add one. If what
  they asked about is not one of those classes, the fix is a detector that can
  look for it: teaching one is free (``modules/teach``), and the banner says so
  first; looking by name with no training is Pro's.
* ``report_unmeasured`` -- the report they just opened lists things that were
  said and never measured, and the routes that could measure them need an
  engine this build does not ship. Which routes those are is read from
  :mod:`modules.report.detection_routes` itself, not listed here, so this cannot
  drift from what the advisor would recommend.

Never at startup, never on a timer, never in a modal dialog.

Why not in the report
---------------------
The report, the findings and the advisor are identical in both editions
(README, "Pro edition"), and a report is something people send to other
people. An offer inside it would be an ad in a document the user handed to
someone else. So the report stays as it is and the offer is a banner in the
app, next to it.

How often
---------
Each edge speaks at most once every :data:`MOMENT_COOLDOWN_DAYS`, and any offer
at all at most once every :data:`GLOBAL_COOLDOWN_DAYS`, so a user who keeps
running into the same edge hears about it once and then gets on with their
work. One click switches it off for good; the About tab switches it back on.

What is sent
------------
Nothing. The state is a local file, and the only network access is the
browser opening :data:`PRO_URL` when the user clicks the button.
