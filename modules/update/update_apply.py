"""Move a verified, staged update into the installed app.

The Windows problem
-------------------
A running program cannot have its own ``.exe`` or its loaded ``.dll`` files
overwritten or deleted — the OS holds them open. Every self-updater has to work
around this. The usual answer is a second helper process that waits for the app
to exit and then swaps the files, which means shipping and maintaining a second
executable.

The trick used here instead: Windows *does* allow a locked file to be
**renamed**. So each file being replaced is first moved aside into a
``.update-old`` folder, which succeeds even while it is loaded, and the new
file is written to the now-free path. The running process keeps using the
renamed copy until it exits — nothing crashes mid-swap — and the leftovers are
swept on the next launch, when nothing holds them any more.

Failure handling
----------------
Every move is journalled, and any failure rolls the whole thing back: files
moved aside go back where they came from, files already placed are removed. A
half-applied update is the one outcome worth real effort to avoid, because it
leaves a program that cannot start and cannot repair itself.

The installed ``manifest.json`` is rewritten **last**, only after every file is
in place. If anything interrupts the process before that, the old manifest
still describes the install honestly, so the next update plan simply resumes.
