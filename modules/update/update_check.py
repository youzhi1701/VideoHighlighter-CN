"""Tell the user when a newer build exists.

Why this is notify-only
-----------------------
The app is delivered as a multi-gigabyte archive, so "download and run the new
one for you" would mean fetching several GB and then executing it — a remote
code execution channel into every customer machine, and the one bug class that
cannot be recalled once shipped. The value the user actually wants is *knowing*
a new build exists; the download itself is one click on a page. So this module
fetches a small JSON manifest, compares versions, and stops there.

The manifest format already carries ``assets`` (with sizes and SHA-256) and a
``signature`` field, unused today. That is deliberate: if downloading is added
later, the wire format does not change, and the rule for that day is written
down here — **verify the signature against an embedded public key before any
downloaded byte is executed**, exactly as ``licensing.py`` verifies tokens.
GitHub account compromise and MITM both stop at that check; without it, neither
does.

What is sent
------------
Nothing. A plain GET of a public static file, no query string, no identifiers,
no license key. The manifest host learns an IP made a request, which is what
any download link already reveals.

Failure policy
--------------
Every failure is silent — no network, DNS down, garbage JSON, a manifest that
has not been published yet. An update check must never produce an error dialog
or block startup; the user did not ask for it.

Edition
-------
The manifest URL is chosen from ``version.__edition__``, so this file is
identical in the Pro and free repos and picks its own channel at runtime.

Where the channel file lives
----------------------------
Two places, both asked; the newest version announced wins, and on a tie the
first one listed here:

1. ``<base_url>/channels/<edition>.json`` on the update host, where
   ``base_url`` comes from the ``manifest.json`` this install shipped with.
   CI stamps it at build time (the ``UPDATE_BASE_URL`` repository variable),
   and ``.github/workflows/publish-update.yaml`` writes the channel file there
   once a release is signed. Nothing about the host is compiled into the code,
   so moving the bucket is a variable change, not a release.
2. The marketing site. ``publish-update.yaml`` writes it too when it has a
   token for the site's repository; otherwise it is committed by hand. Every
   build from before the update host existed reads only this one, and so does
   a run from source, which has no ``manifest.json``. Because the newest
   answer wins, a release announced here for download only is still heard by
   installs whose update host names an older one.

The channel file names one signed release manifest per platform
(``"manifests": {"windows": ...}``). A platform with no entry gets the
download page, which is how macOS stays notify-only: an in-place update would
break the app bundle's signature.
