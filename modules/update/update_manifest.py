"""Read, verify and diff release manifests.

This is the half of the updater that decides *what* would change. It downloads
nothing and writes nothing — it turns "here is a signed list of the files in
release X" plus "here is what is on disk" into a plan: these files must be
fetched, these must be deleted, that many bytes.

Two rules do the safety work:

**Only the signature is trusted.** ``verify_manifest`` checks an Ed25519
signature over the exact manifest bytes against a key embedded at build time.
An unsigned or mis-signed manifest is not "probably fine" — it is the exact
shape an attack takes, since acting on a manifest means replacing executables.
Verification fails closed, including when no key has been embedded yet.

**Only a release meant for this install is applied.** A valid signature says
the vendor published a manifest, not that it is the right one: the unsigned
channel file that points at it could name last year's release, or the other
edition's, or another platform's. ``release_problem`` refuses all three, and a
release that declares it cannot be laid over a build as old as this one.

**Only what we shipped is ever deleted.** A file is removed only if the
*installed* manifest listed it and the new one does not. Anything else on disk
is left alone, which is what keeps a user's imported models, edited config and
license files safe — none of them were ever in a manifest.
