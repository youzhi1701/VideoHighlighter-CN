"""Built-in expression classes for a detected face.

The companion to ``face_examples``: that module matches whatever the user points
at, this one names five expressions with no setup at all. They are the same two
tiers the rest of the app already has — a fixed vocabulary that works out of the
box, and taught categories for everything the vocabulary has no word for.

Both consume the *same crop*. ``face_crops.scan_frames`` finds and cuts the
faces once; the crop then goes to CLIP for taught categories and here for the
built-in classes. No second decode, no second detection pass.

Model: ``emotions-recognition-retail-0003`` from Intel's Open Model Zoo — 5
classes, ~9.5 MB in FP32, Apache 2.0, and OpenVINO IR, which is the runtime
and the packaging path this project already uses for its action classifier. The licence
matters as much as the accuracy here: most off-the-shelf face models are
derivatives that would not survive the commercial build.

What it cannot do is worth stating plainly, because the failure is quiet. Five
coarse classes trained on posed, frontal, well-lit faces: it degrades on profile
and occlusion, has no notion of intensity or blended expressions, and it will
return a label for *every* face it is given, confident or not. Anything outside
those five words is not a low score here — it is absent, and it is what
``face_examples`` exists for.
