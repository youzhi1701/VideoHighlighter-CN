"""Labelled examples on disk, and the COCO dataset built from them.

This is the join between "the user marked some things" and "a detector can be
trained", and it is deliberately ignorant of where a box came from. A box is a
box: hand-drawn, proposed by a taught category, prompted out of an
open-vocabulary detector, imported from the labeller, or emitted by the model
trained in the previous round. Each carries its ``source`` so the record can be
read afterwards, and nothing downstream branches on it.

That indifference is the point. The box sources available here differ enormously
in quality, and the good ones will change:

===================  ==========================================================
``hand``             a person dragged it. The best geometry there is.
``category``         the winning region from a taught category — a fixed
                     fraction of the frame at one of nine positions, so it
                     says *where to look*, not where the thing is.
``labeler``          imported from ``tools/labeler.py``, which stores *points*;
                     each becomes a fixed-size box around the click. Same
                     coarseness as ``category``, for the same reason.
``prompt``           an open-vocabulary detector's fitted box. Real geometry,
                     but the class needs a nameable noun.
``model``            the detector trained last round. Real geometry, no
                     vocabulary limit, and the reason a second round is cheaper
                     than the first.
===================  ==========================================================

Only ``accepted`` boxes reach a dataset. A proposal is a question, and the
answer is a person's.

The split is the subtle part
----------------------------

Labels are grouped into **segments** — runs of labels close together in time in
the same video — and whole segments go to train or to validation, never split
across.

A random split would be wrong in a way that flatters every measurement taken
afterwards. Frames a second apart in the same shot are near-identical; scatter
them and validation is scoring the model on pictures it trained on. The
validation loss then falls beautifully and means nothing, and the "never
promote a worse model" rule the training loop depends on is comparing two
numbers that are both fiction.
