"""Pose estimation backend — RTMPose (Apache-2.0) keypoint runtime.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The counterpart to modules/vision/detection_backend.py. YOLOX answers "where are the
    people"; this answers "what is that person doing with their limbs". The app
    lost the second question when the AGPL YOLO package was dropped, and several
    features were written assuming both answers exist — see modules/crop/pose.py
    for what went quiet.

    Permissively licensed on both halves that matter: mmpose's code is Apache-2.0
    and the weights are OpenMMLab's own release, so a model trained or analysed
    with this does not inherit a copyleft obligation. That is the same bar
    detection_backend.py clears, and for the same reason.

TOP-DOWN, AND WHAT THAT COSTS
    RTMPose estimates keypoints for ONE person box at a time. It cannot discover
    a person the detector missed, so it is not a second opinion on *how many*
    people there are — it is a second opinion on whether a given box is a person,
    and on what that person is doing. Callers that want the first thing must
    lower the detector's own threshold and let this confirm, rather than expect
    keypoints to appear where no box was proposed.

SHAPE OF THE CONTRACT
    estimate(frame_bgr, boxes) returns one entry per input box, in the same
    order, each with pixel-space keypoints in the ORIGINAL frame's coordinates.
    Boxes that fall outside the frame come back with an empty keypoint array
    rather than being dropped, so the caller's indexing into `boxes` stays valid.

THE COORDINATE ROUND TRIP IS THE EASY THING TO GET WRONG
    Each box is expanded to the model's 3:4 aspect (padding 1.25), warped into a
    192x256 patch, and the SimCC output is decoded in that patch's pixel space —
    so every keypoint must be mapped back through the inverse of that warp. Skip
    it and the keypoints look plausible, sit inside the frame, and are wrong by
    exactly the crop offset, which no assertion catches.
