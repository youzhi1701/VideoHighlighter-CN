"""Run the R3D action-recognition model through ONNX Runtime, so a DX12 card
that torch cannot reach still runs it.

Why this exists
---------------
:mod:`modules.system.directml_device` puts R3D on an AMD card through ``torch-directml``,
and that works -- from source. It cannot work in the packaged exe:
``torch-directml`` pins an exact torch (2.4.1) and pip satisfies that by
*replacing* whatever torch is installed, so a build carrying it could not also
carry the CUDA torch the NVIDIA path needs. One process, one torch. That left
every packaged AMD user with action recognition on the processor.

``onnxruntime-directml`` has no torch dependency at all and is already in the
bundle, driving object detection (see :mod:`modules.vision.onnx_detector`). The model
format is the common denominator, not the framework: export R3D once, and the
same runtime that accelerates detection accelerates this too.

Why the export is made here rather than shipped
-----------------------------------------------
The graph depends on the weights, and the weights are not fixed. A user can
import their own fine-tuned R3D with its own class count
(``app_paths.import_r3d_action_model``), and the built-in comes from
torchvision's hub cache rather than from this repo. So the export is made from
the model object the caller already built, cached beside the app's other user
data, and reused. Same arrangement as :mod:`modules.yolo_onnx`, for the same
reason.

Nothing here raises. Every caller already holds a working torch model, so the
answer to any failure is "use the one you have" -- a fallback, not an error.
