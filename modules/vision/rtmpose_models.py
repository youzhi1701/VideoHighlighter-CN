"""Fetch the official RTMPose keypoint models (Apache-2.0) and convert them to IR.

The app has had no pose estimation since the AGPL YOLO package was dropped: YOLOX
detects, and has no keypoint head. RTMPose fills that hole without reopening the
licensing question — mmpose is Apache-2.0, and the exports below are OpenMMLab's
own released SDK bundles, so nothing here is trained or exported with an AGPL
toolkit (see the hard licensing gate in CLAUDE.md).

Downloads OpenMMLab's ONNX SDK zip, lifts ``end2end.onnx`` out of it, and
converts to ``models/rtmpose/rtmpose_<size>.xml`` — where
``modules.vision.pose_backend.find_default_rtmpose_ir`` looks. Mirrors
``modules/vision/yolox_models.py`` deliberately: same cache-then-convert shape, same
"cheap to call again" contract, so the two model installers stay readable as a
pair.

WHICH VARIANT, AND WHY IT MATTERS
    The ``body7`` models are the 17-keypoint COCO layout. That is not a
    preference — the cropper indexes keypoints positionally (``[9, 10, 11, 12,
    15, 16]`` for wrists, hips and ankles in modules/crop/pose.py), so a model
    with a different keypoint order returns numbers that are silently wrong
    rather than absent. A 26-keypoint halpe or 133-keypoint wholebody export
    will load and produce garbage. Keep the layout, or fix every index with it.

TOP-DOWN, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
    RTMPose takes ONE person box and returns that person's keypoints. It cannot
    find someone the detector missed. That is why modules/crop/config.py drops
    DETECTOR_SCORE_FLOOR to 0.05: YOLOX proposes generously, RTMPose decides
    which proposals have a real skeleton behind them.
