"""PyInstaller runtime hook: put installed packs on the import path.

A pack is a folder of Python packages kept outside the frozen bundle —
``packs/<name>/site-packages`` — so the heavy, rarely changing parts (PyTorch
and its CUDA libraries) ship and update separately from the app. This runs
before ``main.py``, in the app and in every spawned child, so ``import torch``
anywhere finds the pack.

Packs are *appended* to ``sys.path``: the frozen bundle is searched first, so a
pack can add packages but never shadow one the app bundles itself (a second
numpy would be the classic way to break everything).

Exactly one pack per ``dep`` is loaded. Two torch builds on one path would mix
a CPU torch's Python with a CUDA torch's DLLs, so when an install holds both
(the NVIDIA pack landed beside the CPU one) the higher ``priority`` in
``pack.json`` wins; a pack without a ``pack.json`` is its own dep.

**Two roots.** Beside the exe, and the per-user folder
(``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\VideoHighlighter``). The installer writes beside the exe;
the app's own downloader (modules/packs/pack_manager.py) does too when it can,
and uses the per-user folder when the exe's folder is read-only. On a tie the
exe's folder wins. The per-user rule must match pack_manager.per_user_dir.

**Maintenance, main process only.** A pack installed while the app runs
cannot replace the one whose DLLs that process has loaded, so pack_manager
leaves two kinds of note for the next start, handled here before anything
imports torch:

* ``packs/<name>.pending`` — a new copy of an installed pack: the old folder
  goes to ``packs/.trash`` and the pending one takes its name;
* ``packs/<name>/.remove`` naming another pack — this one is superseded (the
  CPU torch once the NVIDIA one is in); it goes to the trash, but only if the
  pack that replaces it is really there.

Moving to the trash is a rename, so a folder still held open by another
running instance fails to move and is simply left for a later start. A spawned
worker skips all of this: its parent is running on exactly those files.
