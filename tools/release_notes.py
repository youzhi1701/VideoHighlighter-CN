"""Draft release notes from the commits since the previous release tag.

    python tools/release_notes.py                     # HEAD vs. the last tag
    python tools/release_notes.py --since 0.9.0-Pro --until 0.11.0
    python tools/release_notes.py --out release-notes.md

The build workflow runs this and puts the result at the top of the draft GitHub
Release, which is where the notes live: nobody has to remember to write them,
and the draft has to be opened to be published anyway, so that is where they get
edited into shape.

Commit subjects are already written as "type(scope): what changed", so they are
grouped by type rather than rewritten. Work a customer never sees — docs, tests,
CI, release plumbing — is left out, and the notes say how many commits that was,
so a short list reads as "little changed", never as "something got dropped".

A squash merge titled after its branch ("Claude/amazing ptolemy yf1m4v (#22)")
says nothing, but GitHub lists the commits it squashed in its body as
"* type(scope): ..." lines, so those are used in its place.

"Previous release" is the nearest version tag reachable from ``--until``'s
parent, found by ancestry rather than by name. Tag names here have not been
consistent (``0.9.0-Pro``, ``0.11.0``), and a clone that also fetches the other
edition holds its tags too — unrelated history, so never reachable, so never
picked. Only tags starting with a digit count: ``packs-torch-2.7.1`` marks
published PyTorch packs, not a release.
