"""
CompositionEngine — detects composite events from per-frame object detections.

A "composed event" fires when a configurable set of conditions holds
consistently over a short time window. Two kinds of condition exist:

*spatial* (``rules:``)
    Count how many detections of a *source* class stand in a relation to one
    of a *region* class, and require the count to fall in a range. The
    relation is ``inside`` (the source's centre is in the region — the
    original, and the default), ``overlaps`` (at least ``min_overlap`` of the
    source's area is in the region) or ``touches`` (they meet, or come within
    ``max_gap``). Detections are boxes, or outlines where the cache carries
    ``contours``; see ``modules/rules/shapes.py``.

*signal* (``signals:``)
    Compare a per-second measurement against a threshold, or a per-second label
    against a set of accepted values.

Signal conditions exist because the interesting combinations are not all
spatial. Audio level, vocal brightness and an expression reading are each a
value per second with no box to be inside anything, so a spatial-only engine
cannot express "this measurement is high *and* that label is showing" —
the conditions had to be evaluated in separate places and correlated by hand
afterwards, which is exactly the join this engine exists to perform.

Both kinds are ANDed: an event fires on a second where every one of its
conditions holds. A spec with only signal conditions is evaluated once per
second and needs no detections at all, so signal-only rules work on a video
that was never object-detected.

Configuration is loaded from a YAML file (see composition_rules.example.yaml);
the engine itself contains no domain-specific class names, signal names or
event names.
