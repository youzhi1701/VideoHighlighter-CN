"""A decoder that outlives the frame it was asked for.

Extracting a thumbnail used to mean starting ffmpeg, opening a 5 GB file,
decoding one keyframe and throwing all of it away — 356ms, of which the decode
was the smallest part. Measured on 5760×2880:

    one ffmpeg process per thumbnail        356ms
    kept open, software decode              156ms
    kept open, d3d11va                       54ms

The hardware decoder is worth about 3× *once the device is created once* rather
than per frame. That is the whole reason the cache prefers software for its
per-process path: there, setting the GPU up costs more than it saves. Here it
does not, because nothing is set up twice.

Why a child process rather than decoding in the app
---------------------------------------------------
The subprocess design being replaced had one property worth keeping: an ffmpeg
that fell over took nothing with it. Handing an 8K stream and a GPU device to
an in-process decoder trades that away, and it would be traded away exactly
while a crash that leaves no traceback is still unexplained — the filmstrip
loading is when it happens.

So the decoder keeps its own process. It holds the open file and the GPU device
across every request, which is where the speed comes from, and when it dies it
dies alone: the parent notices, says so, starts another, and the app carries on
with one missing thumbnail. `restarts` counts how often that happened, because
a decoder that keeps dying is worth knowing about even when nothing crashes.

One decoder is shared per video path. Both timelines cache thumbnails from the
same file, and two children would mean two open files and two GPU devices for
one video.
